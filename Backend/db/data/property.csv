But if you are expecting a 5 star hotel standard of accommodation then you will probably be more comfortable staying at a much more expensive Airbnb site,  or a 5 star hotel in the city centre.","Studio Yindi is located in a very quiet suburban area. We value highly the implied support we have from our neighbours.  The most important thing you can do is to be quiet in the evening after 10 pm.   In particular do not stand outside chatting noisily to friends who may be arriving or leaving. After 10 pm please do not chat outside in the garden.  And please close all the sliding doors, so that any conversations you are having inside Studio Yindi are not heard by our immediate neighbours who are probably trying to sleep.

Simply treat our home the same way you would expect friends or strangers to treat your home when you have them as guests!
