14,12351,28044767,Leticia,2019-08-04,"Staying at Vinh and Stuart´s place was amazing, one of  my top Airbnb 
 experiences ever.  They are very warm and welcoming, having made every effort to make feel at  home (including inviting me to the cinema!). Their tips on restaurants, local services and transportation are priceless.  Make sure you look at the their suggestions at the Airbnb site.  The house is a charming town house,  extremely clean and the room was spacious and comfortable.  They have a very quiet dog and there are a set of stairs,  but for me it wasn´t an issue at all. The location is amazing and very safe and quiet, but only a few minutes away from great restaurantes and the light rail. By safe, I meant I took the light rail to the airport at 4 am and had no problem at all walking alone on the streets, just to give you the idea.  The best part was the conversation: they are well travelled, interesting and very kind people. But only when I was willing to talk: I felt  absolutely respected in my privacy!  I strongly recommend you to stay at Vinh & Stuart´s home at Sydney, they are experienced hosts that make a great effort to provide an unforgettable experience to their hosts.",https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/46e8fc97-2fa2-4f94-9bf2-35eafd2aceeb.jpg

23,15253,3488348,Kerry,2019-12-03,"Morag’s apartment is very conveniently located close to the city. I could easily walk the few blocks to Hyde Park and the city, plus I also walked to the Harbour to enjoy beautiful views of the Opera House/ Harbour Bridge etc. The apartment is also close to supermarkets and shops. 
The room is very nicely decorated, with a lot of thoughtful amenities (in room mini fridge, kettle, TV, bedside lamp etc). 
Shower room was very clean, and Morag provided nice shampoo, conditioner, body wash, soap, towels, toilet paper etc.  Water pressure was very good, with hot water readily available. 
Morag (and Charlie) was very accomodating and friendly. 
An in depth personalised guide was provided upon arrival (printed in five/six different languages!) with plenty of information about the apartment/ transport/ restaurants/ the city etc. 
I stayed in early December and although it was hot in the city the apartment had a nice breeze. There was a portable air conditioner (I think) provided but I didn’t use it. 
Would definitely recommend Morag’s apartment for a stay in Sydney ",https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/1441001/profile_pic/1322215123/original.jpg

Walk to the far end of Bourke Street until you get to a marina. If you walk down the left hand side and keep following it round it will take you through the Botanic Gardens and on to the Sydney Opera House. The balcony is lovely to sit on and relax after a busy day.,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/60d87acb-0961-48eb-b538-46e76e2580c5.jpg

John is a flexible, welcoming host who provides great tips about local amenities and transportation.  You are relatively close to a remarkable and stylish restaurant and shopping area.  Taronga Zoo is a short bus ride away as are ferries to the city.  There is quick bus service to the city almost at your doorstop.  The only drawback is that the bus is only hourly and does not operate Sunday evenings.  Other buses are a bit of a hike away, over hilly streets.  If you are happy to be out of the center of the city - and there are reasons to be - this is an excellent choice.

Location is amazing. A comfortably close walk to Bondi Beach. It is exactly where we wanted to be. The location was very quiet. 

The apartment was great. It was nice and spacious, lots of natural light and a really great balcony. 

We stayed with our 1 year old and 2.5 year old. When we walked in, we were a bit worried because there is lots of household knickknacks which were very tempting for the little wondering hands. For some reason, the kids seemed to keep themselves at bay for our stay there so it didn't end up causing any problems.

The kitchen is great with an amazing stove/oven but you are close to so many great places to eat that cooking may not be something to worry about.

The bathroom is nice and cute and very comfortable for use.

The master bedroom is very large and spacious. The second bedroom a bit tighter with a bit of clutter inside but it serves its purpose very well.

All in all, I highly recommend this place if you want the combination of close to all the action but peace and quiet when you need it. A really great building, beautiful apartment and amazing host.",https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/46e8fc97-2fa2-4f94-9bf2-35eafd2aceeb.jpg

Most of you will remember a cool relative or aunt who you loved visiting as a child? That is how I felt at Eilish's apartment. Eilish made us feel at home, and her place sustained that feeling our entire stay. There was really only one negative for our entire stay: on two separate mornings we awoke to a few mosquito bites. This was our own fault, however, as we left the windows open the evening before. This aside, we had a splendid time here.

90,65126,23798936,Deborah,2015-12-09,"Well, not sure where to start! Our experience wasn't a good one I have to say! The place looks nothing like the pictures depict bright and airy and gleaming with cleanliness. The carpets were dirty and stained and not even properly vacuumed, all the doors, cupboards and fridge had filthy fingermarks down them which felt awful to touch.  In the second bedroom the light is blinding that appears through the crack of the wooden blinds as soon as the sun rises. It is so bad that they have left two eye masks corner of bed post (which I wouldn't use) but thank goodness I had my own. The apartment has two flights of steep stairs to the entry just incase you have  bad knee problem like I do. (not in advert)  The washing machine is there but no power point n the dirty laundry so I ended up hand washing. Don't expect to iron them as no ironing board or iron to be found.  Take your own hairdryer as I asked for one and couldn't find it. It would appear the owner lives there as all the wardrobes and any other area of the apartment are crammed with paperwork, dusty ornaments and shoes and stuff sprawled out. The kitchen cupboards are full of used food as well as the fridge. Certainly not my idea of a beautiful stay in Bondi. Only good point about this place is that it's a ten minute walk to the amazing beach where you can get away for the day and try to forget about the unpleasant place you will encounter when you return.  Nicolette was away in Cuba so not really much help or communication during our stay. Nicolette sounds like a lovely person and made contact before she left so no issues before we arrived. Perhaps she is not aware of AirBnb's standards of renting out your property. I hope they can clean up their act for future guests. It seems like Nicolette was making a quick buck while she was away. I am now in my second place on this trip and the contrast is astounding.  I use Airbnb all over the world and this was not up to cleanliness standards. I complained to Airbnb and they have been very professional and understanding with our above situation as I sent them photos. They have compensated us best they can so I thank them for that.  Sincerely hope you can make this a nicer experience for your future guests as place has potential.",https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/30090437/profile_pic/1427453908/original.jpg

There is loads of space (too much for just two people). Also, it is located near the cooler coast, a short walk to Bondi and near to bus stops that take you into the city.

Overall I would describe it as a friendly, funky bohemian place that has way more character than your average hotel. On a future visit to Sydney we would stay again. I don't think we wanted for anything.

117,67112,27973599,Claire,2015-03-17,"I arrived in Sydney from London, UK in January 2015 and have stayed in a variety of hotels, hostels and AirBnB rooms. Finding good quality accommodation in a new country is no easy task, however I can say without hesitation that Liz and Nick's accommodation has been the first place in three months that has finally felt like home. From the moment I stepped through the door they both made me feel welcome, comfortable and relaxed, going out of their way to provide a proper AirBnB experience.

The room I stayed in is spacious, clean and more than I could have had hoped for. The bathroom is exactly the same, boasting a huge bath and separate shower. The breakfast in the morning was a highlight, especially since more often than not I'd be running late for work! Having muesli and a pot of tea waiting on the table was a blessing!

Things to note:

- 5 minute walk to Dulwich Hill station
- Fab location right by the river
- Great hosts, who due to space in their calendar let me stay on another week; their home is that good I didn't want to leave!

So Liz and Nick, if I'm back your way again and looking for a place to stay, please will you put me up again?!

Thanks for having me - it's been brilliant!",https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/af7bb53c-b9af-4bac-8cfd-c03fc9f03b12.jpg
118,67112,6238065,Eoin,2015-03-26,I'd been looking for somewhere close to my home to  accommodate family visiting from Ireland. Liz and Nick's hospitality fitted the bill. A lovely inner west heritage home and very hospitable hosts. My family were made very welcome and Liz and Nick went the extra mile to look after them.

I don't know when we have had such marvellous breakfasts made by Nick and Liz. We couldn't have been looked after any better. Thank you both ",https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/7739292/profile_pic/1377793099/original.jpg

The room has aircon and a great view. The breakfast and amenities are a delight. Lovely hosting, with plenty of tips on great things to see which was brilliant! Very kind place to stay. Location is good - it's about a 30 minute walk to the city centre, and a little longer to the harbourside. There are buses you can take very near, but I largely walked as the weather was fine, and it's a very pleasant walk through Darling Harbour.

If you love nature and the beach, yet still want to be close enough to the city and local buzz, this has it all. The space itself is immaculate and has been renovated with style and comfort in mind.

Melinda’s truly passionate about food and her “barrio”. During the whole tour she was telling us about the history of Malasaña and pointing out little traces of the past that I had never paid attention to on the many times I walked those streets.

El tour se extendió a 4 horas de muy buena conversación y como un plus, Melinda nos permitió cambiar la ultima parada. Venimos de un país cafetero así que preferimos cerrar con un helado artesanal.

Everything was in it's right place, everything you could think of was provided, everything was spotlessly clean and had a real 'family' atmosphere. If you wanted, you could really feel apart of the family if you wanted. 

The internet/wifi was fantastic, the room itself, while small, was cosy, had a heater, and a very comfortable bed. 

You were welcomed to all amenties in the kitchen, and family room downstairs. It's an absolutely wonderful house in a great, safe, peaceful neighbourhood. 

Martha the dog was always there to welcome you and the cat was always ready to have a meow. 

The only downside to the property is if you're expecting absolute, 100% privacy, access to the bathroom is via the kitchen which is an often used shared area, so you can't easily dash to and from the shower/toilet etc quickly. 

If you want to feel welcomed, if you want a comfortable stay, if you want to feel apart of a family, with invites to family dinners, drinks etc then Marianne's place for you. If you also would like to keep to yourself, Marianne's place is also for you, as it seems one of her families priorities is 'respect',  and they'll respect all your choices. 

Thanks Marianne and Brad for a great stay for a month, thank you!",https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/d1a2cded-d004-4779-a4c3-336a7eb4ce28.jpg

Everything in the home was clean and organized and just as described by Nicole and the photos on the listing.  What a luxury to return home each night from an exhausting day in the city to the comfort of this house and the ability to prepare breakfast in the kitchen each morning!  We found Balmain to be convenient to the University of Sydney and downtown.  What we loved most was the flexibility to take a bus, a taxi, or a ferry into town.  All were easy options, with the ferry being the most pleasurable and a taxi ride averaging around $20 from the heart of the city.  Balmain was safe and comfortable to come home to, even late in the evening. Nicole was easy to communicate with before, during, and after our stay.

Birchgrove oval had an excellent view of the bridge, with fireworks from the Parramatta River being really close too - resulting in a synchronised stereo effect.  This was in easy walking distance from the house.
Easy and QUICK to travel into Sydney.  Public transport was easy to access and frequent in Balmain.  Ferry was close enough to walk to, although buses to the wharf are frequent.  Opal card is a necessity for public travel - available at local newsagent. The public transport app was excellent, helped with trains, busses, ferries, walking, with minimum wait time.  
Local shops and restaurants are close and the food was good.
The house is exactly as in the pictures, just with a new pool.  House has aircon (didn't use as was still a bit chilly), with all amenities you would expect in a holiday home.
Nicole was extremely helpful, and her local knowledge was invaluable.

On Nicoles reccomaendation we went down at 9 pm to see the fire works, and then stayed until midnight, having a drink and snacks and our boys played foodball - that was good. During the fire works we had a great view and the park is not packed at all, as you read about other areas.
Nicoles house is great, our boys enjoyed using the playstation, and we all were very happy about being in a house with pool, which we used a lot. 
It is walking distance into Balmain, which is good for lunch and a bit of shopping - and we enjoyed our stay so much.

1 minute away, is fruit and veg shop, chemist (where you can get cash out- weird but true!), restaurants, bottle shop and coffee.

When travelling around Sydney, we found it best to get an 'Opal' card then top it up, minimum top up is $10. These are at the Newsageny around the corner, 1 minute walk away. You can use the Opal card on bus, train and ferry and are much more convienent and cheaper than buying single trip passes. There is machines everywhere to keep topping them up as you need. It's about an hour trip from Sydney Domestic Airport. Train from Donestic Airport to Bondi Junction Station then bus up to North Bondi.

Chris supplied the porta cot with all linen, high chair and the unit was very kid friendly.

The master bed is SO comfortable, I melted into it and slept so well each night.

The kitchen has everything you need to cook your own meals, even some condiments.

Some very helpful products supplied- dishwashing detergent, cloths detergent, body soap, hand wash and even reusable shopping bags.

Definitely a place to stay when visiting Bondi as it's out of the hustle, yet close to everything. All at walking distance, yet if it raining, jump on the bus that's 100m away!",https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/12301326/profile_pic/1392599014/original.jpg

I love the fact I could walk to Central Station in less than five minutes and also up to Crown Street. I wanted to experience that kind of inner-city convenience and that's what I got.

Public transportation to the city or other areas is a short walk away.   (and Sydney has enabled their public transportation to use any tap enabled credit card on public transportation, so you can avoid buying an Opal card).

Most importantly, you'll get to meet Harry!  Harry is a wonderful housemate.  She is well mannered and very loving.  Scratch her belly and she'll love you forever!  If you're not a dog person, you won't understand.  If you are, you get it.

Mr Chien drove me to the train station the next morning when the weather was inclement and I didn't know where the station was.

But the point is not about Donny, but their parents. The first days I was very sad and I didn't like here for emotional reasons. Now I wish I could stay forever, because I had the opportunity to know such wonderful people that are Donny's parents. Please consider the house is alive, it's like in your own house, so expect to clean your room and if you're truly human, you'll want to help the people close to you. 
It's an easy going staying here, you'll get a complete experience. If you want everything ready for you, go to an hotel, if you want to feel like you're really in home, you know where to go.

Es war auch wunderbar, dass Anabela für uns nach dem Markt am Ostersonntag ein traditionelles Osterlamm-Essen organisiert hatte. Ein ganz großes DANKE!

Marjan took care of us both and the other two guests and, luckily for us, he spoke English very well.
We were picked up and taken back to our accommodation with no bother and, fed a tasty light lunch out at sea.
As a proficient sailor and fisherman and, as a Dubrovnik local, Marjan also was great to talk to. He also sends you pictures of your day after the event.
All in all, a great experience for taking in the views of the beautiful local coast and, give yourself the best chance to catch fish local to the area. Novice or not, well worth giving a go.",https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/1441001/profile_pic/1322215123/original.jpg

Es gibt (mindestens) ein hervorragendes Frühstückscafé um die Ecke (La Buvette), allerlei sehr gute Restaurants und Einkaufs-Möglichkeiten sind ebenfalls in unmittelbarer Nähe. Zur nächsten U-Bahn-Station (Kings Cross) sind es gut 10 Minuten, zu Fuß zu Opernhaus und Circular Quai knapp 30 Minuten durch eine sehr sichere Gegend.

Die Wohnung hat eine angenehme Größe, ein modernes Bad und ist gemütlich eingerichtet, einzig der Teppich in Treppenhaus müsste dringend ersetzt werden - aber dafür kann Sarah nichts. Einfach Luft anhalten, Augen zu und durch ;-)

Die Kommunikation war hervorragend! Sarah konnte uns vorgängig praktische Tipps geben fürs Verstauen des Reisegepäcks bis zum Check-In, und sie war auch sonst jederzeit per Mail erreichbar. Leider haben wir sie nicht persönlich getroffen, doch haben wir uns in Sarahs Wohnung sehr wohl gefühlt und würden jederzeit wiederkommen.

Sarah was an excellent host by being helpful and responding quickly, whenever we had an issue.
I'd say that the only ""negative"" point would be the mattress, which it wasn't enough firm for us. Otherwise, everything was perfect : it's a functional, clean apartment.

The main road by the location is convenient, with vibrant shops and restaurants. There are 3 bedrooms, which is very good for families or big groups. However, we ran into some issues with the listing itself. The apartment wasn't cleaned properly prior to our stay and we were missing some amenities. The hosts were able to  supply soap, an additional heater and a small ironing board a day after we notified them on the second day of our stay, but the TV was only fixed shortly before we left. Unfortunately the apartment was never properly cleaned. The hosts were out of the country which made it harder to rectify these issues, especially as they didn't seem to be aware of them. Eventually we were able to get a partial refund. All in all it was very stressful, marring what should have been a relaxing 3 week holiday.

452,232782,26302801,Olivia,2018-07-07,"Pros: 
Really early check-in. Good communicator. Space was relatively orderly. WiFi. Close to multiple bus stops.

Cons: 
NOT IN SURRY HILLS. This is Redfern. Quite far from downtown or the “hip & lively” neighborhood that is Surry Hills.

We had four people in this space for a week, and she gave four body towels. No hand towels, no small face towels, no extras. This made the towels smelly by the end of the week. Not enjoyable.

No heating, no hair dryers. This is listed, but worth calling out as I booked this rather quickly. Made it a cold stay.  She had some space heaters, though, which saved us a lot of cold nights, but took about 24 hours to get the place to a comfortable temperature.

Lastly, we booked somewhat last minute so her rates were higher. When we realized we needed to add an extra person, she charged us $50 additional PER DAY. Even though her listing says $15... by the end of it, was more expensive than a hotel.

Overall would not recommend.",https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/1441001/profile_pic/1322215123/original.jpg

You will spend about half a day exploring a beautiful and pristine river where there's no sign of humans whatsoever (a great alternative to going to the overcrowded Krka waterfalls). It's a very physical activity so you'll be able to work off that Croatian wine and pasta you've been downing all week! 

One tip: be sure to wear flip-flops and check rent the shoes. We were about to wear our own running shoes, but were glad we decided to rent the water shoes. 

Also, we did have a lady in our group who was slightly out of shape. She seemed very embarrassed because she was holding up the group. You should probably be in decent physical shape for you will climbing, jumping and swimming consistently for a few hours.

There were 2 big shopping centers nearby that we enjoyed visiting for grocery and dining but we especially liked the Rouse Hill Town Center.

After arriving a day early, we were lucky that Susannah had an opening for an extra night- 100% grateful for that! Thank you.

Stunning! Light and airy, well maintained and so homey. There was a smart TV so we could watch Netflix before bed. 
Beautiful linen and a very comfy bed.

The room was exactly what I required for 6 weeks; the bed and couch comfortable, the hot water quick to come through and there's plenty of it. I did not use the kitchen facilities, but they are there, and top-of-the-range. There's a washing machine too - all perfect.

Many reviews here mention the renovations - and they are ongoing, but the results are astounding and well worth the the slight inconvenience of noise at 8am. Rob is very concious of this, and will be sure to check in with you.

The location could not be better. At the northern end of George Street close to STC, Circular Quay, and right in the heart of The Rocks - what more could you ask for as a Sydney experience?

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Rob's place to anyone, he is a sincere and caring gentleman who is a wonderful host.",https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/b62939f8-eef2-46b9-89a8-50a98add602b.jpg

573,262192,15630256,Amit,2015-02-27,"Experience: Just OK experience. Interesting stay, but not a 4 or 5 star accommodation. House in the middle of the renovations so couldn’t use the public spaces properly.  The house was not very clean and tidy. Location is amazing no doubt. Sorry to say but not worth the amount of money charged for the room unfortunately. Would appreciate if you update the profile to advise that the house is under renovations and stop taking in visitors till the house is back.  May be Ok for students or backpackers. 

The Host: Very kind and excellent host. Robert has a unique and interesting collection of antiques and the story of the house is amazing. He was very kind to assist with the luggage up to the room and provided very sensible advice and suggestions about local travel and housing in Sydney. Some very interesting conversations about AU politics too in the midst. Robert was very kind to allow me to use the ironing board and iron when needed and even offered the use of the washing machine. 

The Room: - The room was good. The bed-sheets were clean and ironed. Pillows and bed were comfortable. The towels were clean. There was very little disturbance even though the house is under renovations. The house key is very unique and it felt like we are provided with a key to a treasure chest or something (truly amazing).  The room gets very stuffy so opening the windows and the fan really helped but if you leave the windows open cockroaches and house cricket were flying into the room and crawling all over the bed and into the suitcases. Noise from trains overhead on the bridge until midnight or so. I found the Rug in the room was very dirty.

The House: - Although I didn't use the kitchen facilities; due to the renovations, there were lots of cockroaches in the kitchen which was not pleasant at all. The house itself very dirty and felt as if it has not been cleaned for months. Guessing the renovations impacted a bit on the cleanliness of the house. 

The bathroom: - The bathroom very extremely disappointing. Functional but very unhygienic. Pubic hair everywhere in the bath and near the toilet. Looked as if it wasn’t cleaned for months.

The neighbourhood is great - very well located, lots of amenities and great transport connections a short walk away.
I enjoyed learning about the struggle with the government selling the historical buildings (like Robert's) in the area to private interests who'll knock down the buildings for redevelopment, and the public outcry on this.
The renovation work Robert is doing to the property is a huge job, but very rewarding because of the historical accuracy and Robert's dedication. At my time of visiting the ground floor is done, and is rather impressive. The stay isn't quite like any other airbnb I've been to, a unique combination of regal, low-key, and 'rough-and-ready""!

579,262192,153067981,Susan,2017-11-25,"After a cruise around NZ and parts of Australia, we had booked a five night stay in a double bedroom at Robert's Dawes Point home, due to it's close proximity to the Circular Quay area. 
We arrived to be greeted by Robert (whose host photo would appear to be very out of date), and following a chat in his ground floor reception rooms, which had been tastefully renovated in a classic Victorian manner, we were shown upstairs to our bedroom at the rear of the building.
This room consisted of a double bed, with clean bedding and two bath towels; a very large TV; adequately sized mahogany style wardrobe (although the drawers in the lower section were locked and thus un-usable), a small dressing table and chair in one corner; two bedside tables (only one bedside lamp), settee, a corner standard lamp and a rug on the floor at the end of the bed, which in our opinion, needed cleaning.
The 'curtains' on the two windows consisted of a muslin type cloth (one with paint marks) barely stretching across the width of the windows when drawn, and suspended on a sagging cord. They offered no protection from the daylight entering the room.
The walls of the room are badly damaged in parts of the skirting and around some power sockets.
Both sash windows are permanently open at the top by about 15cms and cannot be closed, as there is no method of keeping them shut.
The room overlooks one side of the rear of the pub next door and suffers from noise from the kitchen's extractor fan all day until late evening.
In one of the bedside tables, we found a previous guest's sweater still there, and along with the 'dead' bedside power socket (I had to ask for an extension lead) - one would think that these things should be checked before re-letting the room.
Just inside the bedroom door, there is a small area which I would think may have been a loft type trap door - one of the planks in particular is damaged and is a trip hazard in our opinion. This 'hatch' area is over the kitchen and cooking smells do invade the room, along with conversations from below.
Being very adjacent to the Harbour Bridge, the room is subjected to noise from passing trains.
Needless to say, we were very disappointed with the room, and the bathroom was not great ether, but because we wanted to make the most of our few days in Sydney, rightly or not, we elected to make the most of it.
In our opinion, the paying guests' accommodation should be completed before anything else in the building - we saw no other bedrooms, so can't comment on those.
The host's website photos of this room at any rate, are very misleading.",https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/af7bb53c-b9af-4bac-8cfd-c03fc9f03b12.jpg

The building is vintage - that means you’ll have beautiful cornices in the living room. We loved the city views and especially seeing all the beautiful birds up in the trees. No issues with street noise and the other building tenants seem to be quiet and respectful as well. 

The area is great - you’re steps from Harris market, there’s a pharmacy a block away and the train station is down the block. Add in tons of good, reasonably priced restaurants and a great weekend farmers market - what’s not to love? Don’t forget the street of cafes literally at the back of the building - we fell in love with Orwell’s.

Floors look like a DYI job, not matching up and the skirtings move or not affixed properly. 

Square down lights have been replaced with round ones and rough plastered without painting and finishing off.  

Doors and locks to balconies don’t operate properly and main balcony lock had screw hanging off. 

All of the cupboards are either broken or not working, bathroom mirrors are cloudy, taps leak, mortar missing in large sections of tiles. Walls damaged all over the place, especially the corners.

Only one tea towel. No microwave and Netflix doesn’t work on main tv. 

All in all a strange place and one which needs some urgent repairs and General love. Desperately needs a paint...... and change the mirrors do you can see yourself.

She knew all the good photo spots, and am an insightful, dedicated and passionate photographer. She's an interesting, friendly and bubbly person who you can easily get along with, which really helped me relax when she was taking photos of me. Plus, it's just so easy to work with her. She goes out of her way to work around you and make sure she's capturing your looks, your personality, your character, and she would never impose her style on you. 
Alesya also has her way of helping you look better in the photos (subtly helping you to adjust your postures or making you laugh, etc.) without making it seem posed or artificial, and she is very observational as well, which means that she captures all the beautiful and natural moments like when you're laughing at a joke or when the wind sways your skirt. 

Not only was it a great photoshoot, it was also a different way of  exploring Copenhagen. We did snap a few shots in the touristy areas, but we also found a lot of cute hidden streets and cafes, and she will gladly show you the chic local stores for shopping, coffee and food. 

All in all, Alesya is a great photographer, queen of photoshopping, a sweet person of many talents and an enjoyable presence. Would definitely recommend this to everyone and anyone-let's be real now, good company, beautiful city, AND getting gorgeous profile pic worthy (Website hidden by Airbnb) such a unique experience I really don't know how you can say no!

Lots of love and appreciation for your great work Alesya! xxxxx",https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/58564da1-35c6-44e8-b13f-a9ae0bd5e60c.jpg

Yet, at this hour the city appears to be so different and almost magical with you being the only tourist surrounded by the locals going about their daily business. The distance of about 15km may sound intimidating but Citla built in plenty of breaks into the route and has a lot of information to share and insightful stories to tell covering both past and present of the city and its surroundings. The tour is diverse and coming out of the park you will proceed along the Avenida Reforma with its urban architecture and modernist sculpture stretching all the way to the historic center. Citla has a curious mind and great eye for detail and will point out things you won't necessarily spot on your own. She made many recommendations covering restaurants, neighborhoods to visit and even TV shows (those relevant to Mexcian history to watch). She was kind enough not only send me these over email but also pictures and videos taken during the 3 hours we spent together. If you are looking for an active way to spend your morning as a tourist in CDMX, I can't recommend this tour highly enough!",https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/dfb80caf-6784-4f13-bab8-48bc746a5763.jpg

This house  was a great location to use as a base whilst we were in town. The back yard was our favourite spot to unwind after a busy day sightseeing, and everything was close by, trains, buses, cafes etc. Gretchen made us feel welcome upon arrival and gave us the low down on the house and neighbourhood. My Parents who are in their 60’s had no problem with the stairs the main bedroom situated on the upper floor. This place was perfect from start to finish, thank you.",https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/12301326/profile_pic/1392599014/original.jpg
772,324918,33009779,Tom,2015-10-11,"Our family of four booked Gretchens terrace house in Erskineville for a visit to Sydney to see relatives and do a bit of sight seeing.  

From our initial inquiry Gretchen was super helpful and responsive.  She made all the necessary arrangements for our stay well in advance and made sure everything was in place for our arrival.

The house is located about a 2-3 minute walk from two train stations with regular service to the city centre so getting around was easy.  The Erskineville neighbourhood had an easygoing, slightly alternative feel to it and was well served with shops and cafes.  Gretchen had also left us with a really good breakdown of where to go in the neighbourhood for groceries, doctors, good eats etc (and also some tips on places to avoid).

The house itself was very welcoming.  We felt at home right away and were very comfortable for our stay.  

The house is a Victorian era terrace house and quite narrow (about 4-5m wide) but the spaces are well laid out and the ceiling heights generous so it doesn't feel like a small house.  We had been warned about how steep the stairs were but we didn't find them a problem.  Our first few days in the house there was bit of a heat wave (35C/ 95F +) and while the attic bed-room got a bit stuffy in the evening it was fine with the fan on and the downstairs living areas were a cool oasis so we didn't bother with the AC.

The kitchen was very functional and featured a beautiful timber splash-back.  It was well supplied with equipment and everything worked well.  The shower isn't enclosed and it took us a couple of tries to sort this out without soaking the bathmat but once we had worked this out we were fine.  The dining room has full height glazing and a garden to one side and was a wonderful space to relax in.  

In summary I would definitely recommend for your next visit to Sydney.",https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/5927089/profile_pic/1365989509/original.jpg

The downside- a few things went wrong during our stay: the stove broke so we were 5 days without stovetop facilities and the missing bedroom door handle meant we got locked inside! (although repaired 36hrs later). 

The appartment is quite big and tastefully decorated. There are quality sheets, a well stocked kitchen, all the amenities you could need....but with the 'double room' there is nowhere to hang your clothes, a lot of junk stored in the room and the plug wiring was hanging out of the wall (dangerous).
There is a lovely back terrace but 2 of the 3 deckchairs were broken. So overall I felt it was overpriced for the space offered.

My impression of Joana was that she is a caring, thinking person with a very colourful life she's willing to share if that suits you.

The apartment is not huge, but it's not claustrophobic, your room is more than large enough, and if you plan to spend much of your time in Sydney out and about it will suit you down to the ground.

Joana, thank you!  Best from Tasmania.

The location is great for exploring Sydney with tram and train links only 10 mins away. A shopping centre is only 12-15 minutes away too.

There were 8 of us (which was a bit of a squeeze sleeping wise as this is a 3 bed house) but the downstairs was fine offering lots of room (the kids used the front lounge and the adults the kitchen diner).

The hosts left us some food essentials and the offer to help ourselves to food in the cupboards and fridge which we were very grateful for as this proved most helpful on arriving and for when we run out of pasta!!

I enjoyed very much staying with them: they were very friendly and helpful (also beyond the expected as they also helped me with my work) and made sure that always had everything that I needed. I also liked that breakfast was included (so I had one thing less to bother about during my stay). Even though I didn't spend much of the day in the house, we had some interesting conversations in the evenings. I was also more than happy when Martha offered me to pick some fruit and veggies directly from their garden - absolutely delicious! 
If no-one was around, their labrador Caesar would make sure I was being entertained - by the end of the stay he nearly had trained me into giving him treats whenever he wanted me to ;)
As I had to commute to Macquarie University, the location in Pennant Hills was very practical for me. The train station is very close, and the train ride with 12 minutes was acceptable for Sydney.
I can definitely recommend these hosts and their BnB for people who stay for longer than just a few days in Sydney. The neighbourhood was very quiet and also seemed pretty safe to me. If you don't mind train rides (ca. 45mins to the City), it could also be a good base for shorter trips.",https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/121d6b64-5825-442d-9c2e-c9181c77b11e.jpg

The bathroom is tiny and my husband who is 6'3 cannot fit under the shower. There are no hooks anywhere in the unit to hang wet towels. The toilet seat cover falls on you when you sit on it. The faucet in the kitchen randomly flushes water out when turned off. Also since it's a studio and the bed is right by the door, you can hear everyone opening and closing the doors & talking in the hallway.

The internet speed at the unit was misrepresented. As digital nomads, the internet speed was of utmost importance to us as we work while we travel. I had contacted the host several times throughout the year to confirm the internet speeds. She assured us that it was the ""fastest in Sydney"" and that it would be installed prior to our arrival so she could not send us a screenshot of the internet speed test. I even inquired after it was installed but she assured us that it was the fastest speeds. If the host had sent the actual speed test which we had requested, we would have known immediately that it would not have worked for us and have rebooked another Airbnb. The correspondence between the host was rude as she continued to point out that the space was only fitting for one person to work which was not even the issue on hand here as the physical space had nothing to do with the internet speeds.

Pascal's communication was so helpful, including emailing all the instructions beforehand.  We received a friendly welcome and a welcome package of wine, beer, milk etc.  The house was perfect for our needs, a real home from home, there was everything we could possibly have needed.  It was very spacious allowing our family of three generations to stay comfortably (bedroom and bathroom downstairs for the grandparents and three further bedrooms and bathroom upstairs).  Also lots of space to relax, both inside and outside.  The location was great too - walking distance to the beach and the start of the Bondi to Coogee coastal walk (I definitely recommend you do this walk to take in the beaches of this part of Sydney); lots of shops, cafes and restaurants; and plenty of buses to Bondi Junction or the city.

I stayed with my family there were 7 adults and it property was more than adequate for our stay. The host was easily contactable and was able to answer any queries we had.

950,379498,55161144,Alex,2019-10-14,"Nice location, but a completely unprepared and unprofessional host!!!.

We booked for a 4 month stay, and it was clear from the first day that the host was not prepared.  The host did not prepare the unit for our arrival, did not free up any closet or drawer space, and left his personal toiletries out all over the bathrooms. He was unresponsive and then unavailable for the first week due to travel, so we had to work with his Sister In law to clear some of his things, to make a little room in the closets and clean the bathroom (every drawer and closet space was jammed with his things).  

We chalked it up to an inexperienced host and since we were there for 4 months we settled in.  The first issue came up 4 weeks in when we were charged for the next month with Airbnb, and my credit card initially was declined to possible fraud.  This the host paid attention to and reached out to me with a bit of an aggressive attitude.  I assured him that I would take care of it immediately and processed another payment 30 minutes after we spoke.  Of course when I called my credit card and removed the fraud alert, Airbnb then automatically charged me again the next day, so I would up paying twice.  When I let the host know that and asked for a return of the duplicate payment (~$3,400), he stopped being responsive.

About 8 weeks into our stay we got heavy rains, and the unit was leaking from several places causing electrical issues. We reported this to the host, and asked him to address these issues, and reminded him that he still had not returned the duplicate payment. This is when things went from bad to worse.  He started behaving irrationally and when I was away traveling, visited, without notice on several occasions and intimidated my daughter pointing out to her and getting upset at things like “There are dirty dishes in the sink”, “Your things are out all over the place”, “The carpets are dirty” etc., “The neighbors are complaining about noise”.  I reminded the host that we were there for 4 months, and because he did not free up any closet space, we were forced to keep some things out.  Regarding the carpets, I reminded him that he was supposed to be sending cleaners over which he failed to do in many weeks.  I did take the complaint about the neighbors seriously and could not see why there would be any complaints, so when I went over to speak with them, they had no idea of what the host was talking about.

I again asked the host to address the electrical issues which I thought was a safety concern and instead of addressing them, he threatened us with eviction (the very next day).  That’s when I had to get Airbnb support involved.  The host became very aggressive and started demanding that if we wanted to stay, we had to pay him extra.  He did not send those messages to me, but to my daughter.  I shared this with Airbnb, and let them know that because of the erratic nature of the host, we had to move to a different location.  To the credit of Airbnb, they took this seriously and assisted us through the process.

The situation escalated with the host to the point where Airbnb even subsidized the new location for us because it was more expensive than the one where we stayed.
Thank you Airbnb Support for your professionalism throughout this process.  If you are an international traveler and plan more than a weekend stay, beware of this host, and know your rights as a tenant.",https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/eb1b6d54-7852-4923-9656-0aa43a123d17.jpg

952,379498,102070143,Colin,2020-01-04,"Finding somewhere to stay in Sydney over New Year is always going to be difficult/expensive. We found Micky's place in April 2019 and booked it. It wasn't cheap at 250 UKP/ night (1,500 UKP for 6 nights) for 3 of us staying but nothing was at that time of year.

Initial comms from Micky was good. Welcoming and helpful. Bit of a problem regarding checking in on the day as we asked for comms via email not website as we didn't have access to websites on our phones..... didn't being laptops/iPads while travelling.

Location is good. Easy to walk into city. Good access to buses. Plenty going on in the area. Pieno cafe on the corner was really good and had breakfast there most days. 

Disappointment was the cleanliness (or lack of it). The house needs a really good clean and there is no excuse for this of you are renting out your house.  I took quite a few pictures (if they can be uploaded into ABNB). General dirt, dust, cobwebs and insects.

Checking out was also a problem. No instructions. No response to email the night before we left. Couldn't access keysafe to leave key. Neighbour (understandably) didn't want to take key so had to leave it under a pot in the unlocked courtyard. 

Improvements needed before I could recommend Micky's place.",https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/121d6b64-5825-442d-9c2e-c9181c77b11e.jpg

If you want to pay over-price for poor room and be treated as if you were a homeless person, be stayed for free, so you had to obey your ""kind landlord"" then stay here to experience that!!!",https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/3c9e8337-8f61-4ede-b053-479b09d8b49b.jpg

Pros:
- super central location
- responsive host
Cons:
- lots of house rules you don’t generally have to follow in other airbnbs
- the place was clean enough, but definitely not sparkling clean
- not much privacy when compared to other airbnbs
- steep stairs to get to the room

This place is best for independent travelers, wanderers, and people who prefer to move about rather than staying in for most of the day. It’s not a 5-star room at the Ritz and isn’t catered towards those who expect luxury.

Fantastic apartment with high ceilings and well equipped kitchen. Felt really secure and the dogs are so friendly! 
Paul went above and beyond and was so quick to answer all of my random questions throughout the duration of my stay - despite him being overseas with a time difference - he deserves a host award!
Nothing to fault. For me, it was quirky and perfect.
I would only say if you don't like dogs then maybe not for you. Also, not a party house. 
Would stay again anytime!

We stayed over Christmas and the place was beautifully decorated and lit at night, plus some lovely festive treats awaited us, so we felt like we were at home from the start.  So many things to do from here - kayaking, hiking, fishing, breakfast at Church Point,  lunch at Newport Arms, Patonga or just exploring the waterways locally.  If you want to just stay put and read, watch TV, listen to music, etc, the place is well set up for this with lots of little spots to hide in the shade or stretch out in the sun. The kitchen facilities are good (we managed to cook a full Christmas lunch)  You do need your own boat if you want to explore but this is the local mode of transport and there is a good jetty to tie up to. (or sit on with a glass of wine)  We thoroughly enjoyed our time and wish we could have stayed longer.",https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/b62939f8-eef2-46b9-89a8-50a98add602b.jpg

Turtle Run turned out to be the perfect setting. It's a stunning property perched amongst the most tranquil and sublime setting. Rob, the host, couldn't have been more accommodating.

The one thing to be mindful of with this property is that it's a $25 water taxi ride (each way) every time you want to get back to the mainland for meals or shopping. One night we ordered pizzas for $60 and then it cost another $50 to collect them.

He picked us up from the wharf, showed us around and then left us with a delicious welcome hamper, a bottle of champers and instructions to enjoy his property!  There were 7 of us, the layout of property was perfect - great areas to all be together as well as perfect spots to be alone with a good book and a cup of tea.  We swam, kayaked, fished and went for walks. A boat would've been good, but not a necessity.

The property is stunning, and the large inside living spaces are very well designed and furnished. The three decks and verandas outside are perfect for whiling away lazy summer days taking in the beautiful water views.

The owner met us at Church Point Wharf and kindly gave a lift to Turtle Run in his boat. He’d also very kindly left a welcome basket containing a few food goodies which was most thoughtful.

The house has a fantastic Bose sound system that you can connect to your phone by headphone jack,  and there is also good Wi-Fi and a really comprehensive collection of DVDs

As the property is only accessible by boat this makes for a very private and exclusive experience, and the Pink Water Taxis provide a very convenient service back to Church Point.

We will certainly be back to stay again!

Also the air conditioning wasn’t working, but lucky while I stayed this wasn’t an issue.
The house is sparkling clean, and heaps of space.

1119,430526,3496278,Phillip,2013-01-05,"Our four weeks at Clovelly were very enjoyable in this bright, spacious, airy and comfortable accommodation. The three bathrooms were excellent for our two families and the gas barbeque proved invaluable for this time of year in Australia.  A range of stores and cafeterias were within easy walking distance as was Clovelly beach, a very safe, sheltered bay with additional swimming pool and part of a string of impressive coastal walks.  Larger beaches are within a very short drive. The host was consistently courteous and helpful and remained easily contactable should any significant issues arise (there were none).  We had no difficulty parking our two hire cars close by even on New Year's Eve.  Adjacent neighbours were friendly, welcoming and understanding. The property has an enclosed and private rear garden (with a gate to the park) in which to relax during barbeques.
The centre of Sydney is easily accessible by public transport from the nearby bus stop, the 339 bus goes to Circular Quay which is in close proximity to the Sydney Opera House and Royal Botanic Gardens and from which numerous ferries depart for the various attractions and suburbs.  We travelled quite economically to Manly to visit some distant relatives.  It is a nice location with a few impressive beaches of its own.  Of the larger beaches we preferred Maroubra which was about a twenty minute drive.  Nice for families and surfers alike and not quite as populated as one or two others.
The Blue Mountains range is a two hour train journey Central Station to Katoomba.  Very scenic (and hot in early January, take water bottles).
To organise trips further afield (Cairns, Kuranda, Daintree) we found a travel agent in the centre of Coogee (about 10m mins drive) very helpful in getting the best deal without hours on the internet.  For shopping we found Westfield East Gardens (about 20 minutes) very good, it has an extensive range of shops of all sorts and parking is free.  We found Bayswater Car Rental, King's Cross very good.  A sat nav is a must (understandably). Lots of happy memories.",https://a0.muscache.com/defaults/user_pic-225x225.png

Parking out front was excellent and Leonie was able to organise parking passes for us for just $10 per day, which was brilliant! Unfortunately, the place was not quite as clean as we'd hoped it would be. The room itself was not like the photos, which clearly used filters to give the room the appearance of being white and new. We took our shoes off at the front door, as requested, and as we would normally do in our own home, but our feet were dirty from the floor after walking around for a short while. There was no access to the kitchen, which Leonie told us would be the case from the start. The bathroom was very clean and well kept. The bedroom access is up on the first floor, so keep that in mind if you are bringing heavy luggage. Leonie was friendly for the most part, but did seem to have a lot of negative things to say about our home town when we first met her, which I found quite offensive and lacking in self-awareness.

1177,458203,36029491,Michael,2020-01-04,"Bondi is a world class destination and well worth the consideration of anyone travelling to Australia. The Bondi to Coogee walk is not to be missed. There are a number of great restaurants and the beach life is second to none. Sydney’s public transportation system is one of the best in the world and provides easy access to all that Sydney has to offer. That said, I cannot recommend this specific property.

I travelled with my family of five to Australia from 12/25/19 to 1/5/20.  We had a wonderful trip however, this property did not come close to meeting our expectations.  We paid over $464US/$669AU per night to stay in this apartment.  We recognized that this was high season and the location was central to the beach area.  We also took into account that the property had no water view, only one bathroom, and no outdoor/grilling area.  However, these were not the issues we had during our stay..

The apartment is one of four units in a two story building that has not been recently painted and shows serious signs of neglect. Two garbage receptacles are placed at the front gateway. They were infested with house flies that swarmed whenever we entered or left the property. Heading to the door, the walkway was littered with old leaves and generally unkempt.

The entryway is private as advertised. You walk up a flight of stairs to the apartment which has high ceilings, new flooring, and some nice artwork that are highlighted in the AirBnB photos.  However, it was clear from the start of our stay that the apartment had seen much better days.  The property was not “stunning”, the kitchen table had visible glass marks and the sealant by the kitchen sink wall had deteriorated down to counter. The “designer” furniture included a lamp with a broken ripped shade and a couch covered with a blanket that was stained. Wires and items from the TV/sound system were visible, messy, and cluttered. We expected a bright and clean property yet, there were thick layers of dust on the tops of shelves, the refrigerator, and the microwave. Grease droplets had formed under the hood for the stove and the outside windows were caked with dirt and grime.

Air conditioning was listed as an amenity and in the description it says that the AC is portable.  However, it is a small unit with an exhaust that was too small (even with an adaptor) to fit horizontally in the window. The manager duct taped the opening so that hot air did not pour into the room. The unit was only able to cool the one small room when temperatures hit over 100 degrees that week.  We would have opened the windows and at least improved the circulation in the apartment but there are no screens on the windows and flies entered whenever we opened doors to the back. Our solution was to run the AC, all of the ceiling fans, and keep shades down and drawn (truly no view).

The balcony in the back is described as a retreat with “leafy views looking over a communal garden”. The description does not mention that the washer and dryer are also out there with clothing lines strewn from end to end.  The washer/dryer units are housed on the left end (as you walk out) in a cluttered dusty closet with two broken doors (one was off the hinges and put in the entryway by the manager). The washer did not wash very well (followed the directions in the house book) and the dryer would not run if more than 3 articles of clothing were placed in the drum (maybe 1.5-2kg capacity). At the suggestion of the manager, we hung clothes but that did not create a “relaxing” view. Not that it would, there are three or four planters on the deck, two of which were empty and smelled of cigarette butts and two that had plants which had not seen water in quite some time (we watered them when we were there). I would not describe the tree in front of the balcony as green, it too suffered from a  substantial lack of moisture.   

Bathroom: The drain in the shower was slow and water accumulated after the first minute. The toilet stuck when flushed. We were each provided one beach and one bathroom towel, but only one face cloth and one hand cloth were provided when we first arrived. 

We spoke with the manager on the second day of our arrival. She was available and congenial during our conversation. She promised to have cleaners over to the property that day. She made good on this promise and they did clean the areas I had pointed out. That said, I did not find her to be helpful or understanding when I explained that we did not feel the property met our expectations in either description or based on the price we paid. She offered no remedy or compensation but rather defended the listing and the property (“We do not control the outside of the property”). When I suggested that I should not even have to make calls like this at this price point, she agreed and said I should use the AirBnB site to communicate.  

I did not intend to communicate any further as were having too much fun and frankly, the dinginess of the property forced us to get out and explore. However, when the dryer did not function properly and the dishwasher stopped running five minutes into the cycle, I felt the need to communicate again. I was told that the dryer can handle half of a full load from the washer (it could not) and that I needed to clear out the drain screen in the dishwasher (this was the first time we ever used it). This was consistent for the property in that most things were not in full working order (changed several lights as well).

While talking to the manager, I learned that this",https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/16349201/profile_pic/1443183122/original.jpg

1202,465977,13932765,Alane,2017-03-13,"Really outdated. The place looks like it needs a complete renovation. The roof has quite obviously been leaking for some time. Someone (not any of us) had written ""leak"" on the ceiling and drawn a circle around a spot that was probably wet at the time. There's a lot of bubbling paint and cracks between the ceiling and walls from water damage. Bugs. So many bugs. I understand cockroaches here and there, but there were like 50 cockroaches crawling around the place. And then there were the mosquitos. My husband got to the Airbnb about 5 days before me, and he had about 30 mosquito bites, all gotten from sleeping in the Airbnb. He could hear them buzzing around his face at night. And to be clear, mosquitos were not a problem any other place we went in all of Sydney or the surrounding areas. It was only inside the Airbnb. The mosquitos were clearly a known-problem, as one of the beds had mosquito netting (the bed on the third floor), and there were gross-looking mosquito-repellent devices littered about that smelled horrible. And who knows what chemicals they were putting into the air. They also just didn't work--at all. Lindy had an exterminator come out during our stay. The mosquitos were still a problem, and then there were just dead cockroaches everywhere instead of live ones everywhere. Our only guess as to why the mosquitos were a problem was because there was lots of standing water in the pots outside and in the atrium. It's difficult to tell from the pictures, but the Airbnb is in two separate sections separated by an outdoor space filled with plants. There were also pots with standing water outside the 2nd story bedroom. So, none of the windows could be opened as more mosquitos would come inside. It made for some very very hots nights. Plants were growing inside the walls. Not just a little tendril or leaf coming inside from the atrium, but, growing through the walls, and had been for some time. There was a long vine that was probably 4 feet long inside the house and had grown behind a picture frame and then kept on going. You could also see dirty spots on the walls where other vines and plants used to be attached to the walls and ceiling inside and had just been cut off, leaving the stains behind. There was also mold in the bathroom. Like that kind of mold where it's in the (old, cracked) caulking, so no amount of cleaning will get rid of it unless the caulking and surrounding area were removed and replaced. There were cracks in between the window in the shower, and well as between the tiles. Water is clearly getting behind the tiles. We ended up cancelling our reservation as soon as possible and moving to a new Airbnb. When I sent in photos to Airbnb the customer service reps seemed really shocked and appalled by the photos.

There were plenty of interesting books, CDs, and movies available although we didn't have time to enjoy these. What we also liked was the lovely view from the lounge and bathroom. The only thing was the CDs and precious books etc were arranged on quite low shelves which were accessible by my baby, so we had to block these with luggages and boxes. In hind sight we should have just moved them to a high shelf and will definitely do so in the future. 

The location is fantastic. It's very close to an array of amenities like the laundromat, shops, buses, and doctors. Many nice cafés and restaurants on Hall street are a five minute walk away. Also the walk down to Bondi beach is quite short and easy.

Mary as a host was very responsive and easy to deal with. We had a hiccup at the beginning of our stay and Mary refunded for one night with no issues.

The location is excellent, a few minutes walk to Bondi Beach, shops and cafes, and virtually out the bottom door and onto the spectacular coastal walkway. I expected a steeper downhill walk but the ground level on the northern side is two floors below the street entrance on the southern side, making a considerable difference to accessing the beach. Underground secure parking was an essential for us given that street parking is almost impossible to find.
The apartment is ideal for a couple and adequate for the three of us (retired couple and friend). The two way bathroom required a bit of management given there were three of us, but that said, the large, marble-tiled  shower was fabulous. The tiny kitchen is functional and had everything we needed. The instant boiling water tap was very handy. Rahel had left essentials such as dishwasher tablets and washing powder as well as some nice treats, all very appreciated. All in all, a fabulous Bondi Beach stay.

She likes to have a chat but also understands personal space. I worked in the CBD, and Shushann's place is conveniently close to the express bus to Martin Place. When the express bus doesn't run (late at night and on the weekends) you can easily catch a normal bus to the CBD and to Bondi Junction. It's a short walk to Coogee beach which is fantastic. There's also a great Thai place and Pizza place a short walk away. The bedroom is big, clean, and there's plenty of space to store and hang your clothes. Shushann has a lovely poodle called Anoosh, so you do need to like dogs to stay. In short, I recommend staying at Shushann's place!",https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/718c3beb-1427-4207-888d-784b47dde71b.jpg

This guesthouse flew birds every morning according to the manual and had a beautiful garden. The distance to 'Deniston Station' was a five minute walk, so we were able to use the train fairly easily. Also, there were two big supermarkets at close range and the streets were quiet and clean.

Clean kitchen, comfortable shower and washing machine and dryer... 
The beds were cozy and the recliner chairs and sofas were satisfactory.
We dare to say that this is the best hostel.

She catered information to them but also gave us adults additional info while kids were engaged. She had wonderful little treasure hunt activity books that had our kids writing, drawing and searching all throughout the museum. She also had a Book-Book loaded with paintings or photos of the artists, and other enhancing images of Paris in different time periods, the homes of the artists, other sketches for the pieces we were viewing etc..

While we only covered a small percentage of the museum it all felt perfectly paced. Our two boys are 6 and 10 and this tour was a perfect intro to these masterpieces and this type of museum experience. 

Everyone, children included is capable of understanding and appreciating art but you have to be able to understand how to communicate to your audience. Caroline seems to really believe and understand that too. 

It is such a treat to me that my children had the e patience to sit on a museum floor and sketch in front of a Renoir yesterday. Thank you Caroline!",https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/3e095ce1-85a9-4704-8b63-9e3db336acfe.jpg

1632,655953,12674876,Jason,2014-12-30,"Nice apartment, in a bit of an older building, but you're paying for location here.  About a 5-10 minute walk to the beach, and another 5 minutes or so into the heart of Bondi Beach town.  Unlike some other AirBnB places that are solely rental properties, this is someone's primary residence that's rented when they are away or on holiday.  Translation, their personal belongings are there and the home is lived in.  We've stayed in others similar, so no big deal for us.  The only catch, was the 2nd bedroom is their son's room and decorated accordingly.  We stayed in that room, while another couple took the master.  Overall though, we really enjoyed the stay here.  Excellent wifi, full stocked kitchen, nice bathroom, and apartment stays relatively cool with fans and no AirCon.  Hosts also left helpful tips around surrounding area and offered up his surfboards for use.

1743,698667,5804773,Rohan,2015-01-20,"We had the most memorable holiday over Summer staying at Bevan & Jen's Unit. You can't beat being across the road from Manly Beach. So iconic & relaxing. 

Bev & Jen were supers hosts. They had gifts on arrival, communication was superb and the unit was spotless.  They were really helpful with the little nuances of the unit and the area. The parking permit was a godsend (we had a car full of stuff with two kids) They are A Class hosts. Trustworthy and overflowing with integrity. 

The unit itself is perfectly positioned opposite the beach. Inside its clean and has a beach/holiday feel. It's ground floor in a older style block and therefore doesn't have a balcony or garage. The front windows are double glazed and sealed so there is no road noise at all (the front road is busy at peak times) The one downside is getting good airflow. No air conditioning but with a few other windows opened there was airflow. We had very hot weather and had fans working overtime to keep cool. 

We stayed for a little over 2 weeks and got into a great rhythm in and around Manly. Beach, coffee, riding bikes, more coffee. You will love the proximity to everything and how relaxing it is. Enjoy!",https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/3c9e8337-8f61-4ede-b053-479b09d8b49b.jpg

The ferry is a short walk away too and can get you into Sydney in no time. Sleeping was very comfortable and night time was very quiet, which surprised me to be honest since it was the NYE weekend and there were a lot of people out.

We dined at local spots like the trattoria, Icebergs and Chapter One coffee and wine bar. All within walking distance of Marek’s apartment.

Die Bahnlinie und Geschäfte sind fußläufig zu erreichen und mit der Bahn ist man in ca. 40 Minuten am Flughafen oder in Sydney. Auch ein paar andere Orte und Strände sind so gut zu erreichen. So kann man auch ohne Auto hier eine schöne Zeit verbringen.
Vor dem Apartment ist die Terrasse mit Pool. Schon von hier aus kann man viele Vögel beobachhten und in den Nationalpark sind es nur ein paar Schritte.
Das Apartment ist für 2 Personen sehr geräumig, das Bett super bequem und auch in der Küche findet man alles, was man braucht. Es gibt sogar Netflix, so dass man vom Bett aus deutsche Filme schauen kann. Auch kann man eine Waschmaschine benutzen.
Die Wohnung ist etwas hellhörig, was wirklich das einzig negative ist, was mir zu der Unterkunft einfällt. Die Gesänge der vielen Vögel und die wenigen Geräusche aus der Nachbarschaft haben uns jedoch überhaupt nicht gestört.
