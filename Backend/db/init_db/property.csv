We're big fans of AirBnB for nearly a decade having used it when traveling in the USA not long after AirBnB first started.

Since then we've enjoyed traveling with AirBnB across the US, around Australia, in Hong Kong, and also in Vietnam. We're also hosts.

We're neat & tidy and vibrant conversationalists...

As this is my home, I have some of my belongings in the space, however the wardrobe is clear for you to hang your clothes and make yourself feel at home. The air-conditioner is a portable unit, and so is really intended for extreme weather and should not be used continually. As light sleepers may find it too loud there is also a quiet fan in the bedroom for hot nights. GUEST REQUIREMENTS I request all guests verify their identity with Airbnb's offline ID verification process. It is really quick and easy to do!

One of them is that we're really flexible with check out times. :) While we do work from home, we don't particularly want to broadcast on the internet if we are away from home. That's why our arrival time is always listed as 6pm. Our ""check in"" / ""arrival time"" / ""bag drop"" is all the same thing. It's not like we're a hotel with a team of porters waiting to take your bags any time of the day or night whether we're at home or not. So, if we haven't agreed some alternate arrangements, then we look forward to welcoming you to our home at 6.00pm. While we may be able to arrange some arrival times / bag drops / check ins earlier, we do need to make those arrangements well in advance. So if the 6.00pm check in time isn't your preference, please talk to us about it *before* you make your reservation. :) :)","Our home is centrally located and an easy walk to everywhere (everywhere you want to go anyways).

Ever since Airbnb started in 2011, I've listed home/s in Sydney and (formerly) in Hong Kong—and have enjoyed meeting a swag of guests in the Airbnb international community from all walks of life—some whom have even continued to stay in contact. 

As an Airbnb host, I'm aware of how most guests are not looking for a faceless serviced apartment or out-of-the-box stay. Are you a first-time visitor to Sydney who's coming without a full itinerary? Interested in local knowledge on great activities (pottery classes? suggestions for families and kids?) ... just ask, and I'd happily assist. For guests who already know the city and just needing the great city pad homebase—that's all good, too. Simply send an introduction of yourself in a request to book to start the dialogue...

As an Airbnb guest, I've had the fortune of fantastic stays with hosts in cities (San Francisco, Istanbul, Berlin, etc) enjoying the flexible option of the home stay in a foreign place.

The inner eastern suburbs of Sydney  are swimming in good caffeine and food for that matter - any number of cuisines are available nearby as the area is scattered with amazing restaurants and cafes.  

The inner eastern suburbs is extremely central to what Sydney has to offer and has a great village feel to it.  I love living here and can't imagine living anywhere else and I hope for you to have the same experiences during your stay.

I now do a bit of volunteer work and spend time connecting with friends old and new, and play boules and mahjong when I can.  I am also enjoying discovering walks in various parts of Sydney - I am amazed how I can be delighted by new discoveries in the city of my birth. All the better informed for guests from out of town. 
I have lived and travelled extensively - San Francisco, Tokyo, Saigon and outside of London when I was a child.  Love to travel and meet new people, particularly those from other places.  Have travelled in Asia, and a bit in Europe. Love Italy and la dolce vita.  Have seen quite a bit of the US (my dad took me to New York for my 14th birthday!!) and been on safari in Africa but not made it to other continents yet.  
Can't imagine life without friends, good spicy food and the prospect of another travel adventure.  Have backpacked, and travelled in style, kayaked down rivers and even hiked the Kokoda Track sharing a backpack with my boyfriend of the time.  I continue to travel now with perhaps the focus being on catching up with beloved friends all over the world from the days of living and working overseas.
Now prefer softer options along with a good bottle of wine, delicious food of the region wherever, classical music or some great rock.
Age is a state of mind rather than the years lived, and it is good to be able to look backwards and forwards.

Walk the coast-walk and swim in some of the most beautiful beaches in the world. If you're lucky, depending on the time of year, you'll even see whales. Late June and early July is the best time to see them. This location is truly amazing. Everyday stepping out and seeing the sun on the ocean, great days on the beach, swimming, snorkelling, walking along the coast and then seeing the moonlight on the water coming home. Winter is Coogee is even more chilled out than usual.

It really is one of the most beautiful places in the world. I love meeting people, including people from different cultures and places, which I get to do with my work (most frequently in Timor-Leste) and enjoy this element to Air B and B. 

Although I love to live, work and play in different places, I still and currently call Australia home. Living right on the coast and seeing the sunshine and moonlight on the water everyday is amazing. Totally topped by seeing whales passing by too (at certain times of year) - come and stay at my place and you will want to move to Coogee, Sydney, Australia as well :) I love Summer and swimming in the ocean at all points of the day (and occasional dips during Summer eves too) and also yoga overlooking gorgeous Coogee beach. Also, have just gotten into cycling- as have many Sydney-siders and it is great riding to Surry Hills (where I work and one of the best places for great cafes, shops, theatres and galleries) and do so via Centennial Park, a truly beautiful park. 

I love festivals, particularly world music festivals and film festivals. Sydney has heaps of festivals, so come and enjoy :) food festivals, short (Italian, Human Rights, Gay/ Lesbian/ Transgender, Docos, Bike) film festivals, music festivals, etc etc. It's hard to choose, even when you live here....and when it is equally fun just hanging out at the beach.

We like to know when guests have settled in, so that we know guests have their keys and all is as expected. We also keep this in our rental agreement as we need to know if anything is not working or broken upon arrival so we can fix and replace items. Sometimes it is just a matter of usage instructions and rather than guests tell us at the end of their stay that items weren't working we would prefer to know so that we can send instructions if there is any issue. We are sorry but we do not have the means to check in guests after 11pm.","Standard Terms and Conditions of Temporary Holiday Accommodation Note: Variances can be agreed on but only by arrangement with the owner in writing.  Provided will be: Pillows, Tea Towels, Blankets and Doona’s. Linen for one set will be supplied, if you require further linen, we can arrange a linen hire service that costs up to $75 a delivery. Payment of the rental deposit constitutes the clients acceptance of these Terms and Conditions. We are sorry but we do not have the means to check in guests after 11pm. All bookings made accept these terms. Cancellation, if caused by the client, 50% cancellation policy is not refundable unless the house is re-let for the entire period and only a $50 cancellation fee applies.

We used to have 3 properties on Airbnb so you'll see reviews for other places no longer run as holiday rentals. We cut back because our family expanded so we are now focusing on our children for a few years and might put our homes to holiday rental again one day.

We both work in the design fields, my husband on shows like The Voice and Master Chef and I have worked in design marketing for over twenty years.

We are the owners and managers of our properties. We are not subletting a rental so you won't be evicted should landlords discover you! We do not live in them, so you can be sure of the highest standard and quality as we are dedicated solely to you. We have been doing this for over seven years (long before Airbnb), so we are familiar with the process and have ironed out all the bumps that a newby might not have.

We absolutely love making a space beautiful and want our guests to enjoy our spaces as much as we do.

Meeting guests - especially those visiting Australia - is like having a little holiday without leaving Sydney as we get to hear what their home countries are like. We manage to meet over 80% of our guests to welcome them to town! And this is the best part of being hosts with Airbnb. We have also been really lucky to meet a lot of other local hosts, managers from the San Francisco head office, and the wonderful, warm and friendly staff at the Sydney office. Paul was also asked to speak on the SuperHost panel at the inaugural Airbnb Open in November of 2014 and we both attended the Paris Open in 2015. It was really thrilling to be included with such passionate, professional hosts talking to a huge room full of excited people. 

We have traveled extensively including staying in hotels, hotels, on the beach, and latterly in Airbnb homes. So we really know what makes for a good stay. It's both a pleasure and an honour to have folks stay at here, especially international guests who are traveling around this lovely country.

As an Airbnb host for nearly 8 years and a local Darlinghurst resident for nearly 20 years, I am pleased to offer very well priced prime location accommodation in Sydney’s inner city. 

My place is cosy, comfortable and convenient. And the company ain’t so bad either ;). I don’t make a profit, in fact I keep the price reasonable so it offers regular occupancy but covers expensive living costs in Sydney. 70% of your tariff is based on location.

I am a warm and friendly live in Host who works long hours often into the evenings as  a self employed Consultant, so please don’t think I’m being anti social if I’m not up for a lot of social interaction or eating dinner together etc. thanks for understanding ;).

The ideal guest will enjoy getting out of this small but fit for purpose terrace house and explore beautiful Sydney which is pretty much on our doorstep. 

This accommodation is for a single guest only so no couples and no pets, sharing many of the facilities and shared space including the outdoor, sheltered bathroom. 

This typical terrace house is small and space is limited so simple cooking is fine but facilities are limited. So many guests enjoy the many dining options across the road  especially for their short stay.

Stanley St provides well priced Italian, Japanese, Thai, pub food and cafes plus great coffee especially for short stays.

During reservation booking, please tell me a bit about yourself and  the purpose of visit. Also do advise if you are a non English speaker to help with effective communication and please use the translation function on this platform.

A bit about us and why we share our home on Airbnb: Well, most of the kids have left home, and we've decided our house is too big not to share.  Our own memorable travel experiences abroad and in Australia have converted us to being great supporters of homestay accommodation; we really enjoy meeting fellow wanderers and have first-hand experience in knowing what makes for a great homestay experience.
We both work from our home office in two very different fields:  landscape architecture and  organisational psychology - it makes for very interesting discussions across the office desks!  But, these days we prefer to spend less time working and more time enjoying beautiful Bilgola on Sydney's Northern Beaches.  What do we like?  All the usual suspects: great food and wine; music from every century and style [well, maybe not country ]; books you can fall asleep to; but mostly we like to meet people who also enjoy 'the road less travelled'.
You might also like to check out our 'Secrets of The Garden Workshop' offered through Airbnb Experiences.  Combining our professional skills of landscape design and psychology, we use our own garden to demonstrate ways in which to create special outdoor spaces whilst also unlocking the positive psychological and physical benefits of creating such spaces.

Our house is in a fabulous holiday location and we don't like it to sit empty while we travel if someone else could be enjoying it.

I hope you have a minute to have a look at my apartment in Coogee, which I think is pretty special.

I'm non-smoking, non-drinking, vegetarian.  I meditate as often as I can... and people often remark on how peaceful the house is.  I have been facilitating healing work in the house (using an apparatus from Brasil) part-time for about 9 years. 

I currently work at the Australian National Maritime Museum in a senior role.  But I have spent over 20 years in various policy roles for various Governments in Australia (most recently in Arts policy), as well a being a member of various regulatory boards.  

The ocean is really my thing... and I live here because of the proximity to the beach.  And after the beach would come coffee and pastry - both of which are available just outside the house ;)

I'm dedicated to doing the best I can during this lifetime and I'm hoping to rent out my apartment to cover the costs of pilgrimage to Israel over Christmas and New Year 2016/17.   I've written several books about pilgrimage and holy saints. 

Please be in contact with me for any bookings and inquiries. A good friend will take care of you while I'm travelling. 

I look forward to hearing from you!

My name is Kellie. 

My family (myself, my husband and 3 kids) have been welcoming guests at our Studio since August 2010, but we only started using “airbnb” in July 2012. To see the feedback guests give us about their time with us in The Darling Studio, please see below. We have never had any negative feedback and the feedback is not “cherry-picked” (i.e., we only show you the best of our feedback – we show it all). 

The Studio is a separate residence, sitting at the back of the main house, separated by a courtyard.  Our approach to hosting is to give our guests privacy, however, if you need us or need help, we do our utmost to help ... Whether you want recommendations for the best local pastry shops (Black Star in Newtown), advice about lovely walks around Sydney harbour or local beaches (that us locals use – not just the typical ‘tourist’ haunts) or you’d like a home-made map of the quickest-back-street-way to drive to the airport, we are there for you.  

We travelled through Europe staying in serviced apartments and we use that experience to make our Darling Studio the most comfortable we can for our guests. We learnt what not to do, as well as what travelers appreciate (e.g., some little “goodies” like chocolates, fruit, cereal, some milk and butter or fruit on arrival to help you settle in before your first big supermarket shop); helpful (but not intrusive) hosts, honesty in advertising and so on. 

We have had guests stay as long as 11 months, and others return 3-5 times, so we think that suggests we are getting something right with hosting. We find it a real joy to meet people from all over the world, and help their stay in Sydney be comfortable, friendly and memorable. 

Warm regards & I look forward to hosting you at our Darling Studio sometime soon.
Kellie (with feedback from our guests below).

FEEDBACK FROM GUESTS
What a jewel: This studio is beautifully designed, practical, clean, peaceful with a lovely court yard, and in walking distance to the University of Sydney and Redfern station (one station from Central station). The hosts are most welcoming and helpful while guaranteeing privacy and individuality to the guest. The parallel street is charming, too, with student atmosphere, small coffee shops, deli and restaurants. The Darling Studio is definitely my favourite accommodation in Sydney (Stefan, German/Swiss professor, five separate visits across 2011 and 2012). 

The Darling Studio is my cozy and beautifully designed haven whenever I am in Sydney. The hosts are warm and welcoming with an eye for attention and comfort. The location is ideal - a very short walk to Redfern train station and the neighbourhood is filled with charming cafes and friendly neighbours. I highly recommend a stay (Heather, Consultant, four separate visits across 2011). 

I stayed at the Darling Studio for a week and the only way to sum up the place is to say it was a home away from home! The hosts were wonderful and assisted with all my inquiries (eg. location of hairdresser, train services, best eatery, etc). The Darling Studio was not only clean and fresh but contained EVERYTHING you could possibly need and more than is advertised (eg. DVD's, books, maps, take away pamphlets, shampoo, ear buds, basic foods - just everything). I would highly recommend it to anyone needing a place to stay in Sydney. The price you pay for what you get is great value and only a short distance (via train or taxi) away from major attractions in Sydney. Definitely will be staying there again in the future! (Claudia, Midwife, October 2011). 

I was a Japanese visiting researcher in Sydney University and stayed in this studio for eleven months. It was very convenient for commuting to University and for shopping at Broadway and Eveleigh Markets. On weekends I walked down to Cockle Bay, Circular Quay and Hyde Park and went to suburbs from nearby Redfern Railway Station. The hosts are very kind and friendly. If you want to concentrate on your work in the day and to have a quiet night, you can do it here just as I did (Professor Ueshima, 2010-2011). 

What a wonderful place to stay and so close to everything important; cafes, pubs and shops. I especially loved the little touches, like a pre stocked fridge to help ease you through the first couple of days whilst recovering from travel. Lovely place and helpful happy people to deal with ... what more could you ask for! (Geoffrey, Dislocate Circus Theatre Company, 2011).

... thank you for our stay - we had a wonderful time ... The hospitality offered by you was first rate, and the little touches like providing milk, fruit and bread every so often was highly appreciated (Jim, IT specialist, 2010). 

A word of thanks for making our recent 3-week stay in your beautiful Darling Studio a most wonderfully comfortable experience. The moment you welcomed us, we felt we had truly arrived in our Home Away from Home !!!

I work as a holistic psychotherapist in private practice with specific expertise in the divine feminine.  I love living near the ocean and walk along the coast everyday with my dog, a very sweet miniature poodle. I live in a great neighbourhood with lots of tall trees and lots of colourful and chattery birds. People are very friendly around here and there is a wonderful sense of community.  I'm in close walking distance to the beach shops and buses to the city.

i live in on the top floor of a duplex in a spacious 2 bedroom flat. I share a sunny garden with friendly downstairs neighbours who are into permaculture, so it's always full of veggies and flowers. The room that is available is light and airy and I am only looking to rent to singles at this time or perhaps a parent and child.

So when the opportunity presented itself to acquire this property we jumped at the chance.

We love the proximity to the bush and the beach and call it our enchanted corner of Sydney.  We're removed from the bustle of Manly yet close enough that we often enjoy a family walk along the harbour foreshore for hot chocolate and waffles at our favourite cafe.

While the main house that we live in is still in need of some TLC, we've spent a year transforming the Ranger's Cottage and surrounding garden into what we hope you will agree is a lovely retreat. We're planning to squeeze into it when we get around to renovating the main house, but in the mean time we're very happy to welcome guests, both familiar and new.

My husband and I both share a strong service ethic and I have a background in hospitality. We love creating environments in which people can enjoy themselves, whether that means leaving you to your own devices (the cottage is completely detached from the main house) or helping you feel right at home,

What else about me: I like to collect vintage things and enjoy a spot of baking so you may find yourself the recipient of cookies or cakes during your stay. During the warmer months you might find me first thing Swimming laps along our local beach.

We have two great young boys who enjoy riding bikes exploring the bush and keeping an eye out for the native wildlife.  We also enjoy going to the aquarium, wildlife world, zoo and museums in the city.

Meeting guests - especially those visiting Australia - is like having a little holiday without leaving Sydney as we get to hear what their home countries are like. We manage to meet over 80% of our guests to welcome them to town! And this is the best part of being hosts with Airbnb. We have also been really lucky to meet a lot of other local hosts, managers from the San Francisco head office, and the wonderful, warm and friendly staff at the Sydney office. Paul was also asked to speak on the SuperHost panel at the inaugural Airbnb Open in November of 2014 and we both attended the Paris Open in 2015. It was really thrilling to be included with such passionate, professional hosts talking to a huge room full of excited people.

After former corporate life that propelled me to explore what life has to offer outside of what many people see as an attractive 'career path', I have been happily living an unconventional life experiencing it to the full.

I'm quite active, I love ocean swimming, riding my motorbike, go hiking, skating or long walks to enjoy the outdoors. I go dancing from time to time (tango or salsa) and I channel a fair bit of energy through my creative outlet in photography.
