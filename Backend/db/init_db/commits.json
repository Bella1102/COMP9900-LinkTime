Of course they do have many years experience running a BnB in Mudgie so they know the drill but that aside , they were welcoming, friendly, and forthcoming. I don't know Sydney and they do - which was they main reason I wanted to stay with an airbnb host. This is a great way to beat the lonely hotel blues, a great way to get that 'in' on local knowledge. A lovely room to stay in, fresh and clean - a wonderful breakfast early saturday morning before my flight home ( for which I appreciate and am eternally thankful) the fluffiest happiest best behaved dog Kenji i have ever met,  I thoroughly recommend these host and their home to all. . I think we are actually friends now! see you soon"

Vinh and Stuart were superb hosts...and Kenji their Pomeranian, was equally enthusiastic but very well-behaved and unobtrusive. Their three-story terrace house was unpretentiously stylish but with a retreat-like, relaxed ambience, warm and light. The location was fantastically close to the essence of Sydney...Darling Harbour, Bay-side parks, the City, Circular Quay; all within an enjoyable walking distance.\n\nIn line with the AirBnB concept I felt the way in which we could share time was rich, informative and very flexible. I could come and go as I needed, enjoyed engaged conversation on occasions or the gift of attending to my own thoughts or activities comfortably as desired....A beautiful balance and repose. They also gave me access to their wifi which was great to maintain my internet commitments.\n\nEven though they were often out enjoying to their own social activities Stuart and Vinh ensured that my son (who was occasionally visiting me) and I, felt entirely at home and even cooked us both a delicious breakfast with organic-market bought ingredients the morning I was scheduled to leave. The previous day we'd shared a walk down to the monthly Saturday morning market by the bay. I benefited too from hearing of their travel experiences and valued the opportunity to ask about their business venture...where they help creative people define and empower themselves to 'Make Tomorrow (Website hidden by Airbnb) much so that I've chosen to use their services!\n\nSo in essence...I'm very grateful, enthusiastic and inspired by the time spent with Vinh and Stuart and would highly recommend their 'AirBnB' experience. \n\n  "

It was a real bonus when I realized just how close they were to the Darling Harbour.  Although it was only for a day, I felt really welcomed and taken care of. They even had a very yummy custard bun for me upon my arrival. I didn't realize it would be so cold in Sydney this time of year and had only brought a thin hoody.  It was so sweet and caring of Vinh to lend me his jacket for the day.  When I returned after all the sight-seeing, we ended up hanging out and talked the night away. Even though we went to bed quite late, they were kind enough to wake up in the wee hours of the morning just to drive me to the airport! Vinh & Stuart made my stay in Sydney so memorable. I can't even begin to express how much their kindness has touched my heart. I did not feel like just someone renting a room, but rather a visiting friend."

Before we went to Sydney, they sent us a very detailed information pack, that even included the best taxi route from the airport to their home! In short, they are the BEST!\n\nThe food and beverage they provided was definitely top quality, and their kitchen was simply amazing and oh so fully equipped. After a healthy and yummy breakfast, we are off to a day of sight-seeing (usually planned with the help of Vinh and Stu), and every night when we come back home we look forward to the interesting conversations with them =)\n\nAnd I can't praise the apartment enough. The location was simply superb, bus stops literally at the door step, heaps and heaps of cafes and restaurants, and walking distance to the Fish Market!! As you all can see from the photos, they have an absolutely breath-taking apartment. And let me tell you a little secret - the apartment is exactly as gorgeous as the photos are!\n\nIf that wasn't enough, I must confess that we seriously considered smuggling Kenji back to Melbourne with us... Hmmm... He is without a doubt the sweetest pup in the entire world. Extremely well behaved, he never barked once, and he just loves to cuddle and cuddle.\n\nDear Vinh, Stu and Kenji, thank you guys SO much for making our Sydney trip, and firt AirBnB experience simply amazing! Hope to see you guys in Melbourne soon! =)"

He truly did everything possible to accommodate us.\nThe place is in a great location. There is a bus to Bondi that stops right in front of the apartment. It's really close to George St and there are several nice restaurants around. There is a laundry and dryer in the apartment and also a dishwasher.\nThe apartment is nice but not as nice as you might think based on the pictures. The building is an old warehouse and looks and smells like one. Someone smokes in the corridor outside the apartment and, although the smell never got into the apartment, you could  smell it once you leave it. These are the only negative points.\nFrankly, I don't think that you can find a better deal in Sydney."

The outdoor deck is gorgeous and perfect for relaxing. \n\nThe beds were SO comfortable, and the rooms more than generously sized. It rained a little during our visit and we were more than happy to stay inside on the huge fluffy couches and enjoy being in such a beautiful home. \n\nOn top of this the location made it so easy to navigate Sydney and enjoy Bondi Beach. \n\nWould definitely love to stay again and recommend highly!"

The house met all our individual needs and was perfect for our 8 adult, 2 children family holiday having ample space to chill out and privacy if needed.\nNo problems with booking  this property.

My family had a wonderful time staying there and enjoying all that Bondi had to offer.  Our big surprise was how close the house is situated to the beach and the centre of all activity, a short 2 minute walk to everything, including the buses. Deborah is extremely friendly and approachable and I thank her for allowing us to enjoy our week in Sydney to attend a family wedding. Deborah was wonderful and even allowed us to have a late check-out before our flights, which, given the change in weather to the worst week Sydney has experienced in years, was a godsend. I hope that your beautiful house did not suffer badly from the terrible storms which followed our departure. Thank you once again Deborah, we had a fantastic time."

Clean and tidy with good quality linen, and cupboards filled with essential condiments. The location could not be better, a short walk to coffee shops, and a block away from excellent supermarkets and the beach. \nHowever, local relatives said the area in summer is hectic and noisy at night with drunken party goers, the noise of which would affect 2 of the street side bedrooms. With kids, I wouldn't stay there in peak season. \nThe 2 parking bays are brilliant & essential, again the area gets filled up with casual visitors using all available street space, and Sydney is not shy to charge for parking. \nOverall, I would highly recommend this place."

Deborah has everything you need to stay in the house including beach towels, beach toys, and hair dryers which when you're traveling from the States with girls, is very important.

Susan's Bohemian hideaway is across the street from the best part of the beach and directly above the most popular bar on Campbell Parade (The Bier Garden) Less than 5 minutes to walk to IGA market and a bottle shop.  You'll find Susan both charming and efficient in getting you set up in her apartment.\n\nThis is the place to stay in Bondi if it is available."

The apartment itself was certainly big enough for our family of 3 and we could have comfortably fitted another person in  it. whilst it was described as a fully working kitchen it was only a portable 2 ring cooker and full laundry facilities - be aware the washing machine is shared with the main house and they require access to what is effectively your space to use it.\nit would also benefit from a thorough cleaning from top to bottom and we felt we left it cleaner than when we arrived although on the day we  left the next people were due to arrive an hour after our vacating the property so we were asked to wash the bedding in time for the next person. this quick turnaround is not enough time to cater for people correctly."

John and Pam were fantastic hosts...friendly and full of local knowledge and guidance. We would have liked to spend a bit more time getting to know them better, but everyone's schedules were very hectic! Next time John, I'll bring my paint clothes and give you a hand! The Studio itself is charming with everything we needed at hand. Waking up hearing the birds in the morning was wonderful...such a quiet street that it felt we could have been miles away from busy Sydney. Buses and ferries only a short walk away... perfect position. Thanks so much for helping make our stay so lovely...we'll be back for sure! xxx"

The carpets were dirty and stained and not even properly vacuumed, all the doors, cupboards and fridge had filthy fingermarks down them which felt awful to touch.  In the second bedroom the light is blinding that appears through the crack of the wooden blinds as soon as the sun rises. It is so bad that they have left two eye masks corner of bed post (which I wouldn't use) but thank goodness I had my own. The apartment has two flights of steep stairs to the entry just incase you have  bad knee problem like I do. (not in advert)  The washing machine is there but no power point n the dirty laundry so I ended up hand washing. Don't expect to iron them as no ironing board or iron to be found.  Take your own hairdryer as I asked for one and couldn't find it. It would appear the owner lives there as all the wardrobes and any other area of the apartment are crammed with paperwork, dusty ornaments and shoes and stuff sprawled out. The kitchen cupboards are full of used food as well as the fridge. Certainly not my idea of a beautiful stay in Bondi. Only good point about this place is that it's a ten minute walk to the amazing beach where you can get away for the day and try to forget about the unpleasant place you will encounter when you return.  Nicolette was away in Cuba so not really much help or communication during our stay. Nicolette sounds like a lovely person and made contact before she left so no issues before we arrived. Perhaps she is not aware of AirBnb's standards of renting out your property. I hope they can clean up their act for future guests. It seems like Nicolette was making a quick buck while she was away. I am now in my second place on this trip and the contrast is astounding.  I use Airbnb all over the world and this was not up to cleanliness standards. I complained to Airbnb and they have been very professional and understanding with our above situation as I sent them photos. They have compensated us best they can so I thank them for that.  Sincerely hope you can make this a nicer experience for your future guests as place has potential."

On a future visit to Sydney we would stay again. I don't think we wanted for anything. \n\nThanks Nicolette,\n\nJoe and Hannah"

Accommodation is basic and the plumbing is ancient, but if you can appreciate that as a part of the charm (along with the manual, self-operated lift), you will do ok. We slept well on the bed, thankfully, although our initial attempts to make this convertible couch lie flat so we could make the bed (with the rough flannelette sheets provided) had us quite puzzled. Although located in a busy area, the apartment was quiet. It would not be fair not to warn of the cockroaches in the kitchen. Hopefully that will be taken care of. Free wireless internet was appreciated, the lack of a shower curtain was not: really couldn't contain the water in the bathtub."

The flat is nice and quiet and doesn't suffer from the noise from kings cross. The bathrooshia a wet room and the shower is great. The only improvement would be to have a full bed and not a sofa bed, but that is only a minor critisism other than that the flat was perfect and would definatley reccommend to any one thinking of stopping in Sydney"

The accommodations were clean and comfortable, Liz and Nick went beyond what one would expect. Assisting us with getting to places we wanted to see and suggest place we didn\u0092t know about. When asked of our trip by friends and family we can\u0092t help but reminisce of our time sent at their place. I miss the morning conversation over a great cup of coffee.\n"

You can approach the city within 15-20 minutes by train and the bus service can also serve as a great alternative for people to get to the city.\n\nAll in all, Liz's accommodation is a nice place to live in because it's clean, tidy, friendly and convenient. Plus Liz herself, a wonderful host who always believes the importance of sharing the house...you can really make the most of your stay!"

Their house has the size, splendor and sparkle of a palace but the warmth and comfort of your favorite holiday home! It was immaculate, spacious and tastefully decorated. We had a large double room and the kids shared a  room with a futon each and a television...this set up suited our teenagers perfectly. We had our own private bathroom and access to a further shower if needs we needed it!\nCrystal was away when we arrived however she frequently gave us great advise or answered our questions over the phone. Brian was very welcoming and helped us to plan  two wonderful days in Sydney. It was also lovely to sit and chat with him over a beer or glass of wine in the evening. He is clever,fascinating humerus and thought provoking person and we enjoyed his company very much. Crystal was also wonderful but unfortunately we met her only briefly the night before we left. We regret not spending more time with this lovely, lady, who despite her  busy business trip to Melbourne took the time to help us make our trip to sydney awesome. We loved the city (Website hidden by Airbnb) was magical. I think it must be one of the most beautiful cities in the world. The high powered boat ride was exhilirating, our meal infront of the opera house delicious and the views from the bridge and the cable car going up to the zoo were incredible!! On Crystals recommendation we bought all our presents in Paddy's market..that was so much fun and a great experience. We ate fresh fish on the harbor and ate ice cream by the ton. Once Brian had advised us how to get around with the train and the ferry it was easy peasy and NOT at all expensive...Sunday was a particularly reasonable day to travel. Staying with Brian was the perfect way to conclude a wonderful holiday and we would thoroughly recommend a stayiwith Brian and Crystal to anyone..the kids loved it too .....a telly in every room and an endless supply of DVD's!"

The bedrooms and living space were comfortable and nicely decorated. If the kitchen and bathroom were redone in the same way then this would be a very good apartment for a fun getaway in Coogee."

The location of the accomodation is quite, safe to close to the city. It took us 15 minutes walk to Gorge St and tram and bus stop are 5 minutes away. Sitting in the living room for breakfast, you can see the harbor from the window and you can walk 2 minutes to touch the sea. The lovely dog Kenji is well behaved and always friendly to anyone.

Check-in was at 6pm, but as I had an early engagement, Vinh went out of his way to adjust his schedule so that we could meet earlier in the day.\n\nThe house is easy to access. It's less than a 10 minute walk from Darling Harbour, and 30 minutes from Central Station. From the kitchen there is a pleasant view out onto the bay.\n\nThe house included a good size kitchen, where I was free to use a broad range of breakfast items, or indeed, help myself to anything in the fridge.\n\nThere were two bathrooms, one used by Vinh and Stuart, and the other reserved for guests (as there was another person staying in the house, the guest bathroom was shared). The guest bathroom was on the ground floor, was clean, and had a great shower.\n\nThe bedroom I stayed in was on the top floor of this three-story terrace home. The room was large, and offered a view onto the bay. It included reverse cycle air-conditioning and a television. The bed is a sofa bed. Although I found it acceptable, I suspect it may not have been particularly comfortable for two people (thin mattress that tended to sink into the middle). The room did not have a door, and although visual privacy was guaranteed, as Vinh was working late into the night, light from the floors below did filter into the room.\n\nI was able to use their wireless internet connection, and they had a large range of DVDs and books that I was free to access.\n\nThe guys had a cute and well behaved little dog named Kenji.\n\nI did not get to meet Stuart, but did speak with Vinh on several occasions. He was friendly, fun and helpful.\n\nI highly recommend staying with Vinh and Stuart. From the glass of wine that was offered on my arrival, to the way they quietly moved about the house to ensure I wasn't disturbed, they made for perfect hosts."

We had left Dubllin 24 hours previously and being able to go the 20 minutes to her house from the airport to shower, have cup of tea and fruit, Helen had prepared for us and go to bed for a couple of hours was great. The appartment is beautiful overlooking Malabar beach and Randwick headland. You feel you are miles from anywhere but you are only 45 minutes by the great bus service to Circular Quay in the city. Helen and Sean suggested we get the weekly transport tickets and they gave us the bus timetables. These tickets are great. They cost 42 dollars but allow for unlimited use of bus, tram, metro and ferries for 7 days. On our first day we did the coastal walk from Malabar to Bondi beach and it was glorious. It takes about 4 hours and we got the bus back. Malabar is a lovely area with a small quite beach and a lovely little cafe at one end and an enclosed rock swimming pool at the other beside the golf course. The apartment is great and has everything a person needs, down to a great selection of books to read. It is really spacious and I don't think the view from the balcony can be beaten. Helen and Sean are great hosts and we came away feeling like we had stayed with friends."

She went out of her way to make my stay comfortable and homey. I felt like I was visiting an old friend. The room was simple but quiet and more quite comfortable.  The house is very clean. The garden was amazing and reflects Jude's artistic personality. Her dog was easy going and even if you don't like dogs (which I do), I think you will find this one to be easy to live around.  I thought at first the location would be slightly out of the way of the city center, but I found it to be easy to get to the city center and a very nice neighborhood. All and all I can highly recommend Jude's room to anyone traveling alone."

Her home is very comfortable and in a great location (I walked to the train daily and was a 10-15 minute walk to Bronte Beach).  There is also a gym (which I intended to use), washer dryer, wifi and a lovely outdoor sitting area.

The space itself is immaculate and has been renovated with style and comfort in mind. Highlights in the home were drinks on the deck, the extensive wine list and the fabulous sonos sound system!! \nKaren is a friendly, respectful warm and welcoming host. 110% positive all round experience!!"

We walked down to the beach every afternoon and it was very handy having the local shops on the way. \nWe would definitely recommend this property for anyone wanting a relaxed stay in Sydney's beachside suburbs!"

There are little shops for fresh produce just 5 min from the house (a bakery, a greenery, a minimarket), and buses on Bondi (take 333 for express!) take you to Bondi Junction with a huge mall and bigger shops in just 15 min.\nAll in all, we loved the place very much, and would certainly recommend it to everybody who likes living in style and comfort!"

The decor is well thought out and has a nice relaxed beachy feel to it, the kitchen is well appointed. Wifi worked well and a little iPod stereo for some music. \n\nThe Beach is an easy, close walk, and the bus stops just down the road if you want to go to-and-from the city (catch the 333 for express to city). Lots of little cafes and restaurants close by too. Great coffee and food at Panama House a block down the road.\n\nAnn communicated promptly, the key was super easy to pick up, the apartment spotlessly clean, and we couldn't have enjoyed it more! \n\nGets a highly recommended from us."

It's in a great location, though is set back from the beach a little, but is very close to shops and transport. The apartment was perfectly clean and tidy, and we very much appreciated the toys ! Thanks Ann... the blocks were much appreciated when we hit three days of rain!\n\nMy only suggestions would be to include some of the essentials - there was no extra toilet paper, no dishwashing tablets, and a small bar of soap would have come in handy too. But otherwise it was a great stay in a nice little flat."

There are also wild cockatoos and kookaburras always visiting the backyard. If you have breakfast, give them some bread, they will enjoy your company and often eat from your hand. If you want go to in the city of Sydney, then you can take a bus which leaves from the  corner to the trainstation. From there, you can go where you like. If you like bushwalks, there is a big National Park behind the house where you can see goannas and some impressive bushwalking paths along the river. This was a great experience. Thanks Marianne ;-)"

Everything in the home was clean and organized and just as described by Nicole and the photos on the listing.  What a luxury to return home each night from an exhausting day in the city to the comfort of this house and the ability to prepare breakfast in the kitchen each morning!  We found Balmain to be convenient to the University of Sydney and downtown.  What we loved most was the flexibility to take a bus, a taxi, or a ferry into town.  All were easy options, with the ferry being the most pleasurable and a taxi ride averaging around $20 from the heart of the city.  Balmain was safe and comfortable to come home to, even late in the evening. Nicole was easy to communicate with before, during, and after our stay.  I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others!"

This was in easy walking distance from the house.\nEasy and QUICK to travel into Sydney.  Public transport was easy to access and frequent in Balmain.  Ferry was close enough to walk to, although buses to the wharf are frequent.  Opal card is a necessity for public travel - available at local newsagent. The public transport app was excellent, helped with trains, busses, ferries, walking, with minimum wait time.  \nLocal shops and restaurants are close and the food was good.\nThe house is exactly as in the pictures, just with a new pool.  House has aircon (didn't use as was still a bit chilly), with all amenities you would expect in a holiday home.\nNicole was extremely helpful, and her local knowledge was invaluable.\n"

On Nicoles reccomaendation we went down at 9 pm to see the fire works, and then stayed until midnight, having a drink and snacks and our boys played foodball - that was good. During the fire works we had a great view and the park is not packed at all, as you read about other areas.\nNicoles house is great, our boys enjoyed using the playstation, and we all were very happy about being in a house with pool, which we used a lot. \nIt is walking distance into Balmain, which is good for lunch and a bit of shopping - and we enjoyed our stay so much.\nThe communication with Nicole is swift and easy - so thany you so much Nicole - we sure would have liked to stay longer:-)"

Honestly, Joseph, you and your place rocks!  I couldn't ask for a better place that exceeded my expectations of a rustic beach pad that was more than comfortable for the 4 of us.  Thank you for everything and I recommend this place to anyone thinking about vacationing in Bondi.\" -    MARCEL\n\n\n\n\n\"Our accommodations were ideal - clean and spacious enough for two couples.  Excellent shower water pressure - very important to us !  Location couldn't have been any better - many wonderful shops and restaurants were just a block down the street,  and the beach directly across the street. Our host, Joseph, was kind and courteous (thank you Joseph!), and delivered everything as described in his Airbnb advertisement.  The apartment had an older, comfortable feel to it, which we loved - very 'Bondi.' And to top it off, Harry's (excellent!) coffee is right across the street, as is a laundromat. We highly recommend this apartment - we will certainly be back.  Thank you Joseph!! \" -   STEVE\n\n\n\"The apartment is exactly what the pictures look like ,  mellow environment , safe neighborhood to walk around , easy access to everything (beach,coffee shop,laundry, grocery store) , Harry's java shop across the street very convenient  , the apt. felt more of a beach apt. for me  I would def. come back with friends and recommend Joseph's place. A great place to just relax ... felt like home and missing it \". -  SONNY\n\n\n\"A terrific stay in Bondi.  A great 2 bedroom for the price.  Great shower and back patio.  You can't go wrong staying here\".  -   SHAWN"

The view from the house and the pool across the valley and to the ocean are breathtaking - we also enjoyed many poolside dinners using the bbq. The bedrooms are large and nicely furnished, the living area spacious - we especially enjoyed lounging on the large sofa together to watch a movie. It fit all five of us, which we don't find often. Susanne was a wonderful host, very attentive before we arrived, making sure everything was ok regarding the travel with kids, sending us all information needed and offering help. The apartment has everything you need, it feels like home right away. Thank you, Susanne, for a wonderful time!"

The place is basic but clean and roomy, and there's lots of great coffee and food on its doorstep. Will definitely look at staying here again next time I'm in Sydney. Thanks, Saysana!"

We assumed (as with commercial websites) that the photos would be better than the reality but in fact the reverse was true.  The apartment was nicely furnished, with new appliances and had great sea/Bondi views from each room.   Not to mention a great balcony space.  The photos on the website really didn't do it justice.  Great location a few mins walk to Bondi.  Garage parking (although tricky to get a big car into) was a huge bonus.  Owner was overseas at the time but the rental was easy to organise.  "

It was the first time things broke down according to James but it was bearable. Use a torch, skip using the kitchen sink.\nApartment was clean and pleasant. Was able to reach James when needed. Nice for couples and groups. Not for the elderly as it's on the 5th floor I think. Border line for families with young children."

Also you have a new and nice pool at 5 minutes by walk. You are very close to Redfern station, 5 minutes by walk. \nThe home is gorgeous, big, clean, cosy and a decoration with a very good taste. You feel like home... \nMel is the best host that you could have. Thanks to Airbnb, I had the amazing chance to meet a good friend ! I had so much fun with Mel ! She's great, friendly, helpful. She helped me to improve my english ( go, come, in, to...now I'm the best with that !!!!!!!!!!) I could use so many good adjectives to describe her! Also, a special mention to Harry, her dog, Harry is so cute and she loves playing with her favourite toy, a little pink pig, so funny!!!!!!!\nNeedless to say, if you hesitate with some others places, forget about them and run to Mel's place! You will not have any regrets.\nMel, you already know that, but again I need to tell you that I was so lucky to come across your terrace...\nThank you very much for everything, I will take so many wonderful memories of this 8 weeks !"

She has placed a very nice welcome kit in the living room, including a map she drawn showing the surrounding area of Newtown, information on what to do and how to get around Sydney, even an umbella just in case! Everything you need are there. \nNewtown is the up-and-coming chic part of Sydney with a diverse choices of restaurants, cafe, art scene and shows. From the two train stations within 5 minute walk from the house, Newtown and Erskineville, you can go to Sydney center.\nI would be delighted to stay there again and would resommend her place to my friends and family, knowing that they will be in good hands and in a very nice place."

Lynn was very quick at responding and we had solid communication from booking through to checkout.\n\nThe place is excellent, really nice small touches that you don't pick up from the already great impression we got from the pictures. Also I have it on good authority from the missus that the place was super clean/spotless, especially the bathroom.\n\nThe Newtown area is great. It is a short walk to the train station and the local strip of shops/cafes and restaurants. We had a lovely dinner and breakfast from there.\n\nOverall a fantastic place, host and time that went above and beyond our expectations. Cheers"

There is a lady who lives on the ground floor in a private appartment, however we hardly ever saw or heard her [we even invited her to eat with us but she declined!] and we enjoyed the next two levels to our selves...including a fabulous hamock on a small, but delightful and private balcony. \nPerfect bolt hole in a busy city! Downside... traveling with a newly mobile infant a little scary with the stairs, also parking restrictions but we didn't get booked!!  Overall, a lot of fun. Will return if at all possible."

She was very helpful to let us know where to go in the area, and she even included a map that shows it.  \n\nAlong the main streets, there are many good restaurants and shops, and even a Cityrail station (Newtown Station) to downtown.  Lynn's place was convenient and also quiet.  If you like staying in the suburbs, this is where you should stay at.  But I'd strongly suggest that you be a clean traveler because it is a very clean place.  \n\nIf we come back to Sydney, we'd definitely come back to stay here again."

So if you're wanting to hang out on your own in the house, that's probably less interesting to him. Also less interesting is having lots of nice clean space! So if you're a minimalist wanting lots of space and no clutter, you might prefer somewhere else. Otherwise a nice homely house in a quiet, leafy suburb away from the noise and action. Good for kids and Donny will do anything to assist - even offered his car. "

Nice and leafy and even though you are on a busy road, it felt like you were a million miles away. So peaceful and tranquil.

I was disappointed that breakfast was not automatically included, as it has in 6 previous Airbnb properties I have stayed in, but Cathy did remedy this by quickly providing a loaf of bread and milk.   Unfortunately a number of items: a bedroom door (wouldn't shut); a bedroom window (wouldn't open); a TV and video recorder; and the cold water dispenser didn't work, (or at least 4 adults could not get them to work) and we thought that a little remiss considering the cost of the accommodation.

Rob & Cathy's place at Nth Narrabeen was the best solution for our party of four. Rob & Cathy were very helpful without being intrusive, giving us great suggestions for cafes and restaurants close by and happily informing us about the mini rainforest/creek and its inhabitants that bordered the off-street parking area at the bottom of their property. We were lucky enough to spot a couple of long nosed bandicoots rummaging around! The garden unit was lovingly furnished by Cathy who has created a cosy yet eclectic atmosphere. The three bedrooms  are a decent size and house comfortable bedding (no lumpy mattresses). For wet weather entertainment - board games are available and spotted in the garden - bikes to discover the area, including the Warriewood Wetlands that are just around the corner.  Warriewood Square is walkable (10 mins) but even quicker by car and provides all the usual stores (Woolies, Coles, Bakers delight) you might need to stock up the fridge in the very functional kitchen.  Warriewood Square also has clothing stores & a cinema. Mona Vale is a 5 min drive North & Narrabeen Beach 5 mins south. The Collaroy Hotel is also 10 mins Sth and provided a great spot for the wedding reception post-mortem, beach views, tasty food & relaxing entertainment were enjoyed by all. Afterwards we went and lounged around on the spacious deck area that surrounds the unit before heading to a local Thai restaurant for dinner. Overall we had a lovely time being tourist in our old home town of Sydney. We thoroughly enjoyed the Garden Retreat and have recommended to our family & friends (showing them the slideshow of the apartment) that they give It try when venturing to the Northern beaches."

It was really a pleasure to stay at their apartments and we will definitely come back again.\n\nAll house facilities are exactly as described at airbnb - spacious living room, very cosy, convenient and fully equipped  kitchen, comfortable bedrooms, neat bathroom. Outdoor swimming pool is a great advantage. Stable 5 mbps wifi network  is also helpful for all internet addicts.\n\nThe location is perfect - 5-7 min walk to all major shops, supermarkets,  and to astonishing Dee Why Beach!\nTransport connection with CBD and other Sydney suburbs is also very convenient - it is 5 min walk to several  multiroute bus stops. \n\nI would recommend this accomodation to all who is in search of a peaceful quiet place for spending holidays in one of the best Sydney beach suburbs, but also who wants to stay in touch with vibrant Sydney city life."

Godelieve et son mari Jean-Claude sont tres sympathiques et accueillants. Parking possible dans la rue. Un pied-a-terre ideal pour une famille de 4 personnes."

The apartment is wonderful, the room very clean, the bed quite comfortable, and privacy respected.There are 4 pools for use and also very well maintained. Location was quite easy to get to, about a 20 min bus ride to circular quay for about $3.  Martin is very accommodating  and hepled in every way he could, including allowing me to store my extra luggage with him while I travelled the rest of his amazing country!

We came to Sydney for sightseeing and having fun so Martins apartment comfort us a lot. It is pretty close to the City about 20 minutes by bus or sometimes even Martin gave us a drive which was very nice. The apartment is located in a sleeping area so it is very quiet over there in spite of the airplanes noise from time to time. We liked the thing that u have an opportunity to use a swimming pool, sauna, gym any time u want. Very close there is a coffee place and Chinese food. We had very nice and comfortable room with a great size, king bed and big wardrobe. U also will have your own bath with shower, towels, bath utensils and a toilet. We didn\u2019t expect that hostess would be so nice and friendly to their guests. They took us to the trip to Nelson bay to watch dolphins and spent a good time on the white sand beach and after that we had a BBQ at home all together. So if u want to rent a room and make a new friends choose Martin and Ondat apartment."

Martin is very friendly, energetic and welcoming - always up to do things and show us around when he is able to. We extended our stay by an extra week because staying there was so pleasant and comfortable. Bussing to and from the place was easy enough although sometimes you had to wait quite some time for busses (but that is more of a Sydney transportation thing than anything else).

An unexpected find nearby was the terrific sculpture exhibition on the 2nd floor of the Finger Wharf -work your way around the construction signs up onto the elevator for a real visual treat extending the length of the wharf. A visitor on the street stopped us and encouraged us to take in the exhibit. A great start to our visit to Australia!"

The enormous canvas smeared with red finger paint looked like a bit of a scene out of CSI!\nWe were also charged $30/night extra for having a fifth person (who happened to be a young child).\nOverall, the place was clean and we had no troubles with anything although we would not recommend staying there if you want to be close to the beach or if you intend on spending anytime indoors."

The house is clean, and the wooden floor is beautiful. It is in a great location as the beach is only 10-15 mins walk, and bondi rd is only 2 mins away which has restaurants, grocery stores and accesible bus stops. \n\nThe house has an adequate kitchen and a Huge fridge, it was big enough for the 6 of us but we could only get 5 chairs around the kitchen table. The living room is great, with two couches to chill out on. \n\nThe bathroom was also great with a solid shower. There were towels and even hotel style showergel and shampoo for us which we all thought was very sweet.\n\nIngrid was very helpful and easy to deal with. The whole process went smoothly and she even tried to help out with any issues we had.\n\nThe not so good stuff. The two queen beds were not the best (maybe we are a bit spoilt) and one of our friends found the sofa bed extremely uncomfortable. At night you will hear anyone walking around on the wooden floor and the crows will wake you up nice and early. \n\nAll things considered we had a great time in the area, Ingrid was very helpfull and the house was great."

Christian was extremely helpful and approachable organising the stay and his neighbours were also very friendly and helpful - they introduced themselves, were happy to have a chat and a laugh, and offered local tips about the area. They even offered us some of their spare vegetables! Bundeena itself is stunning - in the middle of a spectacular national park. I couldn't have asked for a better place and overall experience for a relaxing beach weekend with friends."

It was homely, comfortable and beautifully decorated. A walk in the nature reserve is a stones throw away, the shopping centre is a 10min walk and the beach is within walking distance. SBD was a 50 minute bus journey door to door, and after visiting the city it was a great place to return to at night. Palm beach and whale beach are a short drive away and well worth the visit. And if we fancied a lazy afternoon, there were DVDs to watch and games for the kids to play. The BBQ and outside seating area added to the experience and we spent a couple of evenings cooking and sitting outside in the private courtyard. When we return to Sydney, we wouldn't want to stay anywhere else! A highly recommended property with lovely hosts."

They both went out of their way to cater for our family needs including providing a bike so that I could cycle to the beach. We spent an excellent family Christmas at the flat and enjoyed The New Years fireworks at the close beach of Dee Why. I would defiantly recommend their place to anyone wanting to stay outside of Sydney, as great public transport into the City as required but the beauty of being on the Northern beaches! I'm sure we will be booking again when next back in Auz to visit my Brother. Thank you both :-)"

The place is beautiful, I wouldn't be surprised if the lady is an interior decorator.  The photos do not do it justice.  Everything was clean and the place was peaceful.  We didn't find having other people on the property in separate accommodation intrusive.  It is extremely handy to shops, park, beaches etc.  What we loved unexpectedly was the property backs onto a dirt road which gives you access to a boardwalk through wetlands.  My kids had a wonderful time riding their bikes there.  For a family it was just magical.  It is very spacious and we would definitely like to return.  Thank you Rob and Cathy!"

Her house is extremely comfortable, quiet and a lovely relaxed atmosphere and we were also able to meet the other guests that were staying at the same time.\n\nI would thoroughly recommend staying with Ruth as it was a priviledge staying with her at her home.  Woollahra is a great location providing access to Bondi Junction and connections to the great beaches of Sydney and Circular Quay, either by bus or boat."

The house is really clean and looks exaclty as in the pictures, no surprises there, appart from the garden, which is even prettier than on the pics. For anyone wanting to stay in Sydney, Ruth's place in Woolhara offers it all: some peace and quiet, a quick walk to the beach in Bondi and it's only about  10 minutes away from Bondi Junction (Busses into the City or trains (another 10 min.)).We're definitely going to come back :)"

The accommodation is central to all major transport spots, and very easy to move around from this location. Ruth is the most incredible woman, (don\u2019t know where she gets the energy from), but between her busy life, makes you feel more than welcome and is a hive of information for any Holiday maker, or Business man! Really enjoyed my 7 day stay there, and can recommend this as a five star accommodation spot! Thanks Ruth, really had a great time, and\u2026\" I\u2019ll be back! \""

We did so because it was incredible value for money for the amount of space, amenities, and a sense of feeling like you were at a home away from home. Margaret and Peter were very welcoming and accommodating hosts. They catered for our every need from: offering chocolates in short supply, redirecting lost pizza delivery guys to our apartment, and even allowing us to have some friends over for dinner. Our requests were always received with a smile and then promptly fulfilled. Organizing details with Margaret was easy and she always got back in a very timely manner. \n\nAs for the apartment, unbelievably it is \"better\" than the pictures. It really is clean, modern, spacious, and has everything you need in order to live comfortably. We had a car to drive us around but there were several large shopping centers just 5 minutes away, along with bus stops with routes that can get you all around Sydney. And if you want to spend a night in, they supply a list of restaurants you can order take out and have it delivered in. The apartment (while attached to the main house) is fully self-contained and privacy is not an issue. If you want the home away from home feeling while still living in a bit of luxury then this apartment is perfect. A special \u201cthank you\u201d to Margaret and Peter for being such wonderful hosts, lovely people, and making the trip just that extra bit special."

Judy then drove me to my venue, not too far away, but saved me the walk. Much appreciated Judy.  Shared bathroom was spotless, good size bedroom was more than comfortable and full of character.  A lovely homemade granola brekky with yogurt was a lovely start to the day.  Safe and divine location, walking distance to harbour foreshore, train and ferry.  Bliss."

Stef and Marc had left local maps and directions for everything we might needed to use it the apartment.\nThe apartment was a great location for the shops, 25 mins to the beach and the bus was a 2 mins walk down the road.\nThis was so much better than a hotel.

Their place is a 2 minute walk from Bondi Westfield, 4 minutes to the train station, tack on a little extra to get to the beach - but the bus is always an option.\n\nI can't recommend this place highly enough!\nWe had a really great time and Stef and Marc make a warm, and lovely couple..\n\nThanks again!"

We had a fantastic stay, the apartment is extremely comfortable and has an eclectic range of books to browse through after a busy day exploring the city.\nAlthough we never met (as Jenni was overseas), Jenni ensured that we were well taken care of by calling me as soon as we checked in and she was always very prompt to respond to any queries we had during our stay.\nThe location of the apartment is fabulous;Coogee beach is a great place to stay and is about 15 minutes to the airport and to circular quay. \nOverall, I would have to say that I HIGHLY recommend Jenni's apartment. She makes every effort to ensure her guests have a great experience."

Communicating with Jenni was easy and straightforward. Overall my parents experience was excellent. Jenni's place matches in all points the description on airbnb, and we had no complaints. I couldn't ask for a better place for them to stay in Coogee. In addition, my sister also slept (at no additional charge) for a few nights on the couch in the living room, and it was very confy. The place is particularly well suited during the hot summer days and is literally footsteps to the park and coastal walk. Everything you need is within a short walking distance.\nOnce again, thanks Jenni you are a special soulful host! I definetely recomend your place to other aibnb users!"

The location is idyllic, minutes from the beach, shops, restaurants, yoga and Sydney's best coastal walk. Jenni is a gracious and thoughtful host \u2013 very hospitable and friendly. We arrived late and even though Jenni was overseas she rang to make sure we were settled. She even left a fine bottle of wine for us chilling in the fridge which was a lovely gesture. We would recommend Jenni\u2019s to anyone else looking for a peaceful and relaxing Coogee experience. We will DEFINITELY stay here again and again ! Obrigado barak Jenni ! "

Robert is an architect by trade, so if you're into old houses, you'll love this place.\n\nThe only downside is that the upper bedroom faced toward the train tracks, so if you're sensitive to noise you might be disturbed when they start running at 6:00am."

I would probably stay there again - especially because the location is ridiculously good. The main downside was that the room (especially the rug on the floor) didn't look like it had been cleaned beforehand and it takes 4 flights of stairs to get all the way up to it."

This property is in a great location-- on a quiet street but very close to Circular Quay and the rest of The Rocks. Less than 7 minute walk to Circular Quay Station and less than 15 minute walk to Wynyard Station. The house is gorgeous, and while it is undergoing renovations I never had any issues with noise or disruptions. The rooms have gorgeous views-- I could even see glimpses of the Opera House from my room! I really enjoyed my experience!"

The only reason i gave 4/5 instead of 5/5 is because of the current restoration taking place (we didn't hear any annoying buiders though - the tradesman working in the day was a polite gentleman who worked exceptionally quietly) - when the resoration is complete the place will be absolutely stunning!\n\nOur room was perfectly formed with a comfortable bed and ample storage space. The proximity to all tourist landmarks was excellent. Just over a 5 minute walk to Circular Quay so it was easy for us to visit the Zoo and Manly beach. We walked into the central city area and again very close and all walking distance away.\n\nRobert was a fantastic host too. Breakfast was always beautifully laid out and our conversations were so interesting. It's so nice and refreshing to meet someone who is so passionate and dedicated to his work. Sydney are lucky he's restoring the townhouse to it's former 1840's1"

However, I believe this only adds to the house's charm."

The room was spacy, the bed was comfy, the breakfast was always laid out for me. When i arrived a nice big towel and fresh soap was provided for me. Robert himself is very nice and attentive. We talked a lot and he shared me a glass of merlot when i was hanging out warming my self in the kitchen one night. It was not cold for Australia of course, but i came from Jakarta where it's 31 degrees celcius everyday, so an 18 degrees was a little too chilly for me. \n\nHe's slowly renovating his place, so there are some mess here and there but not arround your room, kitchen, or places you stayed in. I didn't mind that at all. I recommend everyone to stay at his place, specially if you want easy walk to the harbour, circular quay and other places nearby.\n\nThanks Robert, i had a great stay at your place, i will return if i plan another trip to Sydney again. Cheers!"

Also, Bronwyn was a superb host/landlord. For e.g., when I commented to her that I needed a desk to do work on, while staying there, the buzzer to the apartment rang a few hours later with Bronwyn unpacking a table and trestle legs from her car. What a gem!"

The trip was not particularly strenuous, but interesting enough that even experienced canoe/kayakers will enjoy themselves. I would highly recommend this trip, especially if you like being out on the water. - I will warn: First, it is very possible the trip may go a little long, as traffic from larger boats or struggling group members can be unavoidable. Second, the trip ends at a beer garden, and by the end of the trip you will definitely be looking forward to sharing a beer with Florian and the rest of your crew. For these reasons, it's probably not a great idea to schedule something immediately after your trip, as I did. I ended up missing the beer garden and still being late to my next tour. I would give it at least an hour after the trip, just to avoid any delays cutting into other activities. "

The scenery is wonderful, and the Biergarten with refreshing cold beer at the end of the tour is a great way to end the day. Cheers to Florian!"

Or just walk in to the city in 20 minutes via Wooloomooloo and the Domain. \nThere are lots of cafes and restaurants in the vicinity, as it is close to Darlinghurst Road; that also makes for a rather lively atmosphere on a Friday/Saturday night.\nAll in all a great little place, excellent value for money and it would be my first choice as a place to stay next time I visit Sydney!"

The flat was lovely-very clean, spacious, lots of natural light and cross ventilation being a corner unit. Hugh had outfitted the flat with everything you could need for a longer stay (e.g. nice bath towels and bed linens, washer/dryer, well provisioned kitchen, lots of storage space, TV, movies,  iron, hairdryer, etc.)  When Hugh learned I needed a charger for my iPhone, he lent me one! And while his wireless network card didn't work for my iPad (only for PCs) he was able to get me wireless internet access codes from elsewhere. I appreciate his responsiveness and attention to detail in the flat. I will stay here again on my next Sydney business trip."

Public transport and Kings Cross station are a couple of minute away, the city centre and several parks  are only a 15 minute walk, any queries were dealt with via email promptly, overall a pleasent stay.\nIf i was to be critical we were disturbed a couple of times late at night by itinerant street people.\n would stay again if we visit Sydney.\n\np.s the lifts a classic"

            "comments":"I enjoyed my week in Hugh's apartment... it was clean, very comfortable & well fitted out, with amazing views and was perfect for a longer stay in Sydney. Having the market next door was very handy, and the apartment excellently placed for public transport (both from the city and from the airport). \n\nA few things to note:\n- the windows are very low and open completely, so this apt wouldn't be suitable for small children.\n- the bathroom is older; it was clean, but not as modern as the rest of the apartment.\n- the building itself is a bit on the shabby side, but the apartment itself is modern and light inside.\n- you do have to walk through a short 'red light district' to get to the metro from the apartment, but it's pretty harmless really, and as a single female traveller I felt fine.\n- there is no air conditioning, which means it's necessary to sleep with the windows open when it's warm... I don't know if the apt. would be so comfortable in the summer months as it gets VERY warm due to the large windows. Also, unfortunately during my stay the level of street noise was unbearable for several nights -- even with ear plugs, it was extremely noisy until 3/4 in the morning. If you are a light sleeper I don't think this would be a good fit.\n\nHugh was an excellent host & answered all my questions promptly, and had no problem with me checking in early due to my very early international flight. I thought the apt was very good value & I'd stay again (but maybe avoid the weekend!)"

It was light, airy and  very comfortable with all mod cons and  great views of the Sydney skyline from the huge windows. The location was wonderful, close to the subway, supermarkets and some wonderful restaurants.  Hugh was a perfect host, extremely helpful and responded to all our queries promptly.  This was our first trip to Sydney and we enjoyed it tremendously and a large part of this was due to being able to stay in this lovely apartment in a great city.  We would love to stay here again on our next visit to Sydney.  Thank you Hugh ---- we had a great time!\n\n"

Very nice terrace facing the bay.\nDescribed as a luxury apartment, the price surely is! \nAt such a price, one would expect everything impeccable (the apartment is worth it), mostly if one stays a whole week. The apartment lacks proper service and maintenance:\n- 2 light bulbs did not work when we came in and we had to ask Edan to replace them\n- silverware, plates, pots and pans are of poor quality and insufficient quantity to organize a dinner with 8 people. No tablecloth, no napkins. BarbQ on terrace in bad shape.\n- probably lack of regular cleaning in the kitchen where we observed blats.\n- door windows to the terrace of poor quality\n- the unlimited internet is actually very limited and it is too bad we had to put pressure on Edan to fix it. This should not happen.\n- finally, Edan should propose a cleaning lady even if at extra-cost and a safe box.\n\nOn a positive note, bedding is excellent and bathrooms in good conditions.\n\nYou have to be aware that 2 bedrooms face the railway and trains can be heard passing. Really not a big issue except for people with very light sleep, and possibility to put the A/C on and close the windows."

            "comments":"As the photos would suggest this penthouse is in a great location. The photos are not tricked up. Great harbour views from the balcony.Beautifully located just a moment from Luna park. Seconds from the ferry which runs like clockwork over to Circular Quay from Milsons Point. it is only about 6 or 8 minutes by ferry. So the apartment exists! So too Edan. No drama as to access to the apartment and Edan swung by to ensure that we were settled in. The penthouse is luxurious. Beautiful and quiet upstairs master bedroom with palatial King size bed and ensuite. on the same level a private pool and extra bathroom servicing the pool. Downstairs is a very generous second bedroom with ensuite and a smaller third bedroom with two singles. Plus a third bathroom and laundry. So the description of the property is very accurate. I noticed a review commenting on noise levels from trains and the bridge. Look there is a little bit of noise but don't be too worried by it. We weren't. We stayed with three kids and I don't think they noticed it and the upstairs master is very quiet. I do agree with reviews suggesting that there should be a higher level of crockery and glassware. The arcoroc does not do justice to the setting. a bit of a shame to have such a minor glitch. Cheap crockery and substandard glassware. $500 spend and this glitch would be gone. For instance there were no champagne glasses at all. There should be in a place of this quality and price and I suspect many would wish to drink in the views with some bubbly or decent wine. Invest $500 on some decent crockery and glassware and my major complaint would be silenced. As to the neighbourhood, I have never stayed in Milsons point before and was a bit worried about being isolated. No problem there. As I have said beautifully located to ferry to Circular Quay.There is also a fantastic strip of restaurants and caf\u00e9s 5 minutes walk away in Kirribilli. We were really impressed with the variety and quality. So we had a really enjoyable stay. It is not cheap but the way I looked at it, with a party of 5 the choice was 2 or 3 hotel rooms or a splurge on an apartment. Glad I splurged!\nMike T"

A few years old it is now starting to show a bit of wear and tear but nothing that interfered with our enjoyment.  The beds are very comfortable and the  kitchen adequately equipped, the wifi was good throughout the property, the air conditioning struggled a little to cool the place on very hot days, the non-ensuite bathroom has no shower curtain hence the floor gets flooded after a shower.  Having said all this, I rented this apartment for overseas visitors who were stunned by the view of the Harbour Bridge, Circular Quay and Harbour to the west - I have seen all this a thousand times and was equally impressed!  Edan, the owner, was always contactable to answer any queries."

The location is indeed spectacular with a fantastic view of the bridge a great place from which to explore Sydney are the surrounding area. Edan was very welcoming on arrival and explained how most of the appliances, etc worked. We found there had been a leak in the roof near the main terrace and the doors to the terrace didn't close properly and so could not all be opened though this didn't really effect us. There was a further leak when we had some heavy rain but again it wasn't a major problem. The main issue for us was the aircon which we couldn't control in the bedrooms so it was difficult to maintain a comfortable temperature. The issue with the lack of a shower curtain was also a problem for us but the wifi was fine. Overall we had a great time and would happily stay again."

You will have to keep an eye on when they are home - if you like to be social The place i's perfect for those travellers that want to split themselves between Blue Mountain and Sydney City. Its one hour to each direction by train.\n\nI recommend for others travellers - especially those who like to see Blue Mountains.\n\nTips to other travellers:\nOn the Assuntion St side of Rooty Hill just a few shops. On the other side of the Train Station a lot of cheap Asian markeds and  restaurants. And near to Assuntion Street: Try the Indian Restaurant \"Masala Time\" - its brilliant. "

            "comments":"Excellent hostess, location and accommodation!\n\nFrom the minute my boyfriend and I arrived at Coleen's house she was gracious generous and welcoming!\n\nAccommodation:\nWe enjoyed a good size bedroom with plenty of storage for our 20 kilos each clothing.  The bed was very comfortable (I even asked her for the brand of mattress) and there were fresh sheets and towels once a week as well as access to her laundry if we needed to do any washing.  Coleen allowed us to use her kitchen and all that was in it and even allowed us space in her fridge.  \nShe has a spacious living room that looks out onto her garden which has a plethora of herbs and lettuce that she welcomes you to use as much as you like!  We took full advantage of newspapers and useful articles that Coleen left out for us that she thought would be entertaining or helpful.  We were given our own key to come and go as we pleased.  We had virtually a private en suite with shower and bath as the bathroom was right next to our bedroom.  The wireless was sound and fast.  The house was clean and comfortable, exactly what you hope for on your journey.  \n\nLocation:\nColeen is conveniently located near St Peter's station which is in Newtown.  St Peters provides a 15 minute ride into the city centre or a link to the station that takes you straight to the beach!  Newtown is a bohemian, alternative vibrant community.  It is littered with young professionals who enjoy the international mix of food and culture, students who come for the affordable drinks and food and families looking to be close to the city and remain in touch with their chosen theatre and arts lifestyle.  There are plenty of coffee shops, restaurants, cinemas, grocers and clothing shops.  \n\nThe hostess:\n\nColeen could not have been more pleasant, helpful, understanding and thoughtful during our time at her house.  She truly welcomed us and made relevant and interesting recommendations.  Coleen has great knowledge of international and Australian travel.  She has great tips and advice for all levels of travel either for the locality, where she actively, snorkels, bush walks and cross country skis or Australia-wide. My boyfriend and I were permanently moving over and needed interim accommodation and Coleen had been so generous in her recommendations and as well as her personal assistance with her references and use of her computer.  Over the course of our stay we shared a few meals and many coffees and by the time we left, we felt our stay in Australia was widely influenced by Coleen\u2019s generosity and excellent hospitality.  \nShe is a lovely intelligent lady with great coffee to boot!"

Coleen is an excellent host and we spent quite some time together cooking, eating and talking. She was really helpful and knows a lot about things to do and see in Sydney. Our room was nicely decorated and spacious enough and the bathroom next to it was only used by us, which was very convenient. We could also use her kitchen and washing machine and the WiFi is very fast.\nColeen's house is perfectly located in a quiet area of Sydney\u2019s Inner West. Nearby King Street offers a plenty of moderate priced restaurants (mainly Asian), lots of vintage stores, boutiques, cafes, bars and pubs. Sydney Park, which is great for jogging, is also really close as well as a huge shopping center.\nWe really felt \u201cat home\u201d and would definitely stay again with her."

King Street Newtown, famous for its shops and restaurants, is at the end of the street as is a gym and the open space of Sydney Park. We made good use of all of these facilities.\n\nWe are very grateful to Coleen for having provided us with a home away from home."

His response time to any of my questions even before I booked was quick. There are a couple not so great reviews that I asked Sonke about and he was honest with all my questions. At the time of booking they were in the process of getting a new dishwasher and told me which wasnt a big deal for me. After all the information he provided i felt comfortable to book and i was 100% satisfied. Also very accommodating with my check in/out time. He meet me at his place at check in and gave me a run down of the place. There was fruit, juice and freshly ground coffee there for me. In the bathroom on top of my towel a new toothbrush. I actually felt like I was at home which was really nice when it was raining. I loved staying at Sonke loft and the space is brilliant. The place was spotless and everything has it's place. The loft is tucked away at the end of a quiet lane and there is an abundance of things to do within a 20 min walk. There are 3 grocery stores within a 5 min walk, endless restaurants to try within 5 mins and a short walk to all the night life. Hope you have an amazing time. Book!"

Second bathroom would be nicer with ventilation as it was pretty stuffy without any window or air.\n\nHaving a bbq pit and a balcony was brilliant, top it off with a terrace! Spacious kitchen with all utilities provided but no sponges so we had to buy our own. Dish washer works fine but i still need to clean a little before putting it in just so they are completely clean. \n\nMy friends and I were having problems with pest in the house. Maybe could improve in this area.\n\nGina was very helpful and was offered to lend me another fan because of my miscommunication from previous conversation. The apartment was very well equipped as we found a secondary fan around the house. \n\nLocation is good! Close to the bus stop, bondi junction and the city. Basically we were in the middle of sydney.

The location of the unit is great, in a small block of units right above all the shops you could need; cafes, pharmacy, groceries etc. We had a hire car and appreciated the secure parking as it can be hard to park on the street. The entire building however lacks maintenance and even though it is modern has an air of being 'shabby'; weeds in common garden areas, non-working water feature, wobbly cement blocks on the roof terrace.  The unit also has a 'needs a good bit of maintenance' air about it. We agree with a previous comment that the lack of windows in the 2 bathrooms and kitchen tends to make the unit feel stuffy. Having said that we did enjoy our stay and did find Gina concerned and prompt and we appreciate her attention."

The apartment is located in a quiet area, but was close enough to reach Bondi Junction by a 15 minutes walk. It took about 15 minutes to drive to the city area. \n\nThe apartment was spacious and had all necessary amenities. Gina and Rachel were also very helpful in anwering our queries, and, particularly Rachel, who was very understanding towards our concerns and unhappiness.\n\nSome points that made the stay less ideal:\n\n- Bed was dirty upon check in, but was resolved the next day by resending the cleaners to clean up the apartment again. Hygiene also needs to be improved on the overall as we encountered pests during our stay.\n\n- Inflatable bed for the fifth adult didn't work well. However, the folks at Bondi Beach Holiday Homes were nice to deliver a mattress instead.\n\n- Although secured parking in the garage was provided, the space allocated for Bellevue #1 and #2 was very small and poses extreme difficulty to fit 2 full-sized sedan cars. There was also completely no lights in the garage, which made parking even harder in the night. \n\n- Neighbours were not friendly, but it can't be helped."

Darlinghurst is brilliantly located, with loads of interesting cafes and restaurants around.  Close to Kings X + we were able to walk to Darling Harbour, Circular Quay, Wooloomoloo, Potts Point, Rushcutters Bay etc. etc. Angelique was helpful and solicitous - we had a problem with checking-in late evening and she sorted that out for us very well which was much appreciated. A great place to stay - highly recommended."

It was perfect for the conference our group attended at the University. It's located very conveniently -- a good half hour walk into the city, hour to Botanical Gardens and Art Gallery, but there's plenty of good public transportation linking her house to the rest of Sydney. The house itself is gorgeous. The pictures don't do it justice at all. It was such a pleasure to wake up and breakfast looking into her patio, share a meal together in the evenings at home. it was spotlessly clean, spacious and quiet. It was a perfect stay.

With the light railway and range of bus routes at the end of the road, we were glad not to have bothered hiring a car. Our children particularly loved the waterfront walk - taking in the playpark and cafe.\u00a0\nThe house was spotless and Kathy had thoughtfully left information about the area along with the house manual, which we really appreciated.\nI much preferred the experience of staying in a home to squeezing into an impersonal hotel. And it was lovely to meet\u00a0Kathy just as we were leaving for the airport.\nI wholeheartedly recommend Kathy's home and hope to someday return there too.\u00a0"

This was definitely the best tour I have done, it is excellent value for money, I got to see and learn so much, and all while keeping fit! I was a bit worried about running 15km\u00a0in the altitude and heat, but the pace is up to you and there are frequent stops, including to hydrate. If you are in Mexico City and want to get out and run whilst seeing the key sites and learning about them, this is for you. I would recommend doing this tour at the start of your stay in case you find a place you want to go back to. Thanks Citlaltzin for a great time!"

            "comments":"Citlaltzin is a wondeful and professional running-host. Running this 15KM (we ended up doing 21KM, but that was voluntarely) was a fantastic way to explore the city for the first time. Citlaltzin is ver knowledgable about the history of the city and the way it devoloped. We saw a lot of interesting symbols and landmarks that she could specify and explain in a way I could never have myself, seeing it for the first time. Citlaltzin also knows very much about the development of the indiginous people living in and around Mexico city and how the city became what it is nowadays. Thereby, Citlaltzin is a very nice, caring and fun person to spend your time with and she will make you feel comfortable whatever your pace or level is. Truly recommended for running lovers."

This house  was a great location to use as a base whilst we were in town. The back yard was our favourite spot to unwind after a busy day sightseeing, and everything was close by, trains, buses, cafes etc. Gretchen made us feel welcome upon arrival and gave us the low down on the house and neighbourhood. My Parents who are in their 60\u2019s had no problem with the stairs the main bedroom situated on the upper floor. This place was perfect from start to finish, thank you."

            "comments":"Our family of four booked Gretchens terrace house in Erskineville for a visit to Sydney to see relatives and do a bit of sight seeing.  \n\nFrom our initial inquiry Gretchen was super helpful and responsive.  She made all the necessary arrangements for our stay well in advance and made sure everything was in place for our arrival.\n\nThe house is located about a 2-3 minute walk from two train stations with regular service to the city centre so getting around was easy.  The Erskineville neighbourhood had an easygoing, slightly alternative feel to it and was well served with shops and cafes.  Gretchen had also left us with a really good breakdown of where to go in the neighbourhood for groceries, doctors, good eats etc (and also some tips on places to avoid).\n\nThe house itself was very welcoming.  We felt at home right away and were very comfortable for our stay.  \n\nThe house is a Victorian era terrace house and quite narrow (about 4-5m wide) but the spaces are well laid out and the ceiling heights generous so it doesn't feel like a small house.  We had been warned about how steep the stairs were but we didn't find them a problem.  Our first few days in the house there was bit of a heat wave (35C/ 95F +) and while the attic bed-room got a bit stuffy in the evening it was fine with the fan on and the downstairs living areas were a cool oasis so we didn't bother with the AC.\n\nThe kitchen was very functional and featured a beautiful timber splash-back.  It was well supplied with equipment and everything worked well.  The shower isn't enclosed and it took us a couple of tries to sort this out without soaking the bathmat but once we had worked this out we were fine.  The dining room has full height glazing and a garden to one side and was a wonderful space to relax in.  \n\nIn summary I would definitely recommend for your next visit to Sydney."

(although repaired 36hrs later). \n\nThe appartment is quite big and tastefully decorated. There are quality sheets, a well stocked kitchen, all the amenities you could need....but with the 'double room' there is nowhere to hang your clothes, a lot of junk stored in the room and the plug wiring was hanging out of the wall (dangerous).\nThere is a lovely back terrace but 2 of the 3 deckchairs were broken. So overall I felt it was overpriced for the space offered.\nI would recommend staying in the front room."

The estate in which the apartment is located has a gym, swimming pool and visitor's parking. We had our own room, direct access to balcony but private bathroom (but it was across the corridor). The room was rather small but has sufficient cupboard space. All other services such as kitchen, dining space, television, washing machine and dryer are shared with Gregory and Sally. The place is suitable for people who like animals as the Apollo the dog shares the apartment. The friendly rainbow parrots are a delight and are happy to have breakfast with you.

We especially liked the beautiful ceiling and the artwork. The place is even more spacious than it looks in the pictures. We got a very warm welcome from Scott and he and his wife really made us feel at home. We enjoyed Marrickville, and had nice cheap dinners at the Thai and Indian restaurants just around the corner. The house is close to the train station so it actually didn\u2019t take long to get to the center.  "

            "comments":"We were greeted by Scott and his family when we arrived. They are very friendly, and Scott showed us around the apartment. The apartment, like stated, is really massive, and more than enough for two to stay in. We were expecting less, but actually got more than we hoped for. The bed is comfortable, and the kitchen has all the utensils needed for us to cook anything! There's even an ipod dock, that we used throughout the week to play music. In the afternoon of our arrival, Scott shoed us around Marrickville; the shops, restaurants, and the train station, which is really near the place, and in walking distance. There is a Woolsworth supermart just at the end of the road as well. Really accessible if you just want to buy something and rest at home, or take a train to the city.\nThe next day, Scott and family took us to a morning market nearby, which was really interesting. Even my girlfriend, who has been living in Sydney for more than a year now, did not know that there is a market near here.\nAs for the apartment, we were free to do anything, and come home whenever we wanted to, as the apartment is on a separate building. Privacy was good too, no one came up the stairs during our stay.\nOverall, it really was a pleasant stay for us. We would like to come back and stay someday if we have the chance.\nScott is a very nice person, he and his family are very warm and friendly too. He is willing to show us around, and even asked for us if the restaurants around the place is halal or not. He even offered us a jacket if we want to go to the Blue Mountains. Scott really is a good host, and I think we can stay as friends as well. Hope we can meet again in the future."

They helped us with getting to and from the airport, finding our way around Marrickville and Sydney public transport and had lots of suggestions for fun things to do during our stay. Scott's full of great stories about life in Sydney and their home is full of laughter and creative activity. We instantly felt like we were part of a big happy family. \nThe apartment is exactly like it is in the pictures, so there's not much to add: if you like the pictures, you'll like the apartment. There are some fun details in the handles of the kitchen cabinet and the free-standing bench that will appeal to you if you're a science geek like me. The location was perfect for us. The local main street is only 5 minutes walk away and it has every thing you need -- Asian restaurants, cafes, bakeries, fruit and veg shops (with fantastic grapes and pomegranates). You might not wake up with a view of the Opera House but Marrickville is a suburb with an interesting history where real Sydney people still live, which is an attraction in itself. \nWe had a great time, and are already trying to find an opportunity to go back."

Above all, we got to eat their fabulous scrumptious home-cooked meals with fresh harvest of corns, cherry tomatoes, purple potatoes and vegetables from their garden. We like Phil's home-made loaves which are fresh with full of grains and seeds. The house is fully furnished and complete to make you feel at home and you get the feel of living in a cottage with colorful species of  birds in front of the kitchen window. If you are fortunate, Phil will show you what is \"Moon Flower\" and how they blossom. Whilst their home is only 5 mins walk to the\ntrain station for quick access to other parts of Sydney, you do not really\nneed a car to incur unnecessary expenses to your travelling. On certain nights, Phil would screen good movies. My family's stay of 1 month was indeed very meaningful, educational and enriching; particularly with Phil & Martha's style of retirement living. Thank you for being such wonderful hosts, Phil, Martha and Lucien."

Sarah was amazing, leaving us breakfast food and little toiletries, answering all our questions, helping us when we arrived and giving us recommendations on what to do and see while we were in town..she went above and beyond anything we could have imagined.  The apartment is in a great location, close to all the things that we wanted to do and see.  The apartment was clean and very cozy and was just what we needed for our stay in Sydney.  I would totally recommend  you stay here!"

Sarah has obviously put a lot of her personality into the decor of the apartment and it is completely charming! It is also very functional and has all the little things that make it feel like home. \n\nAs for Sarah, she could not have been a better host. She was a delight to correspond with the entire time.  She was extremely helpful and always quick to answer any questions.  Further, although she was out of town when we arrived, Sarah arranged to have her fantastic friend Nic (And Toto the dog!) greet us and show us around. There were even some tasty breakfast treats waiting for us!\n\nThe location of the apartment was perfect for us. We loved exploring the Kings Cross / Potts Point area. It seems like anything you want can be found right in the neighborhood (Tip: We loved the Indian take-away just across the street!) Also, the train station is seconds aways so that you can get to anywhere else in Sydney quickly.\n\nI would highly recommend Sarah's apartment to anyone visiting Sydney. In my mind, staying at Sarah's is the type of experience that will make you never want to go to a hotel again. 5 out of 5 Stars!"

It was always nice to be able to return to the apartment each evening after a long day out and about in Sydney, especially when it had such a comfortable bed!  Having stayed in many areas in Sydney over the past few years, I can highly recommend Potts Point for being very accessible to everywhere and everything any tourist would wish to do.  Sarah was very easy to communicate with, she always responded quickly which is a big help when you are planning a trip from afar.  Would definitely love to stay here again and would highly recommend the apartment for a stay in Sydney."

The double glazed windows and blinds help to keep out the noise and light :)\nThe apartment is comfortable for two people with all the amenities.\nI would be happy to stay in the apartment again."

We would never have experienced these villages on our own. We had a lovely lunch on the square in Sayalonga. The pace of the tour was comfortable and allowed plenty of time for photography and a coffee stop. Cipriano was attentive to our needs and we felt like we were spending the day with old friends.

The place itself was very nice. A stylish and eclectic decor throughout and a very comfortable bedroom with shower en-suite. The very large deck area outside the living room was the stand-out feature, a great space for dining/relaxing with plenty of outside furniture. Jenny was away for the first part of our stay but returned a week later. She was really friendly, relaxed and easy to get along with. Overall, a really pleasant stay."

A grocery store is across the street, as well as many different cafes and eateries. It is also the perfect distance from the beach. Far enough away to avoid crowds but close enough to walk. The bus to CBD is RIGHT outside the apartment building, making a fast one bus travel to the heart of Sydney. The only thing of note was the limited wifi data available. Light browsing is fine, as stated in the house rules, just don't plan on streaming videos or uploading many photos. Although this wasn't a draw back, my husband and I had planned on getting international SIM cards anyway. So just a heads up. If we ever travel back to Sydney we will definitely stay again.

The apartment (Studio 8) is perfectly located, immediately across the road from a supermarket / bottle-shop and various eateries, and only 20 minutes walk to the beach! The apartment itself was clean, tidy, bright and airy, and as good as it's pictures make it look. Whilst relatively small it's layout made it very functional, and almost immediately felt very easy and comfortable to stay in. I wasn't sure about the  \"wall-bed\" but it was very easy to set-up and then was unusually very comfortable to sleep on (not too firm,not too soft - just right!). The louvered window blinds made adjusting the light and/or breeze very easy, and the air-conditioner worked very well when it became too hot for the lovely Bondi breeze to cool it down. The pool on the roof-top was clean and well-maintained and the view from it spectacular."

I had everything I needed for a comfortable stay & loved the location - a short walk to Bondi Beach, supermarket & eateries at my door & public transport to the city.  I didn't have any difficulty finding unrestricted parking on a nearby side street.  Check in & communication with Ann couldn't have been easier.  Highly recommended!"

The bed was very comfortable and was really easy to pull down from the wall, the kitchen was perfectly good and the balcony is really pretty. It was very clean and the studio is completely sun-filled, one of the things I loved the most! \n\nAnn was good with communication and everything went really smooth both with check-in and check-out. I couldn't recommend it more and I am really jealous of your future guests getting to stay here. Thank you Ann for being a great host! If I get the chance I will definitely stay here again.\n\nBest wishes,\nSara"

We will certainly recommend any traveller to Sydney to consider staying with them rather than a hotel. They gave us great tips for shopping, restaurants and places to visit while in Sydney. To give an example of how considerate they were to us, Sydney was particularly cold the few days we stayed, and they went out and bought electric blankets for us to stay warm.

Also lots of space to relax, both inside and outside.

It made things very easy for us, juggling a busy schedule with the ease of being able to come and go as we needed. The house itself is fantastic, 2 great sized bedrooms, convenient located bathroom and a large living and kitchen area down stairs.

There was every amenity you'd need, clean kitchen, easy to use washer dryer, and comfy beds. I had a small issue (which was my own fault, I couldn't find the heater but I thought it was broken) and Micky dropped by very quickly to help me find it, brought many batteries etc. He is clearly a very attentive hosts and cares deeply about making sure his guest has a great stay. \nThe true star of this place is the neighborhood, it is literally steps away from great bars, restaurants, shopping, etc. I tried to explore Sydney and visited several other neighborhoods, but Surry Hill and Micky's location in particular kept pulling me back. \nOther things to consider: \nThe bathroom lights are a bit wonky because they are timed so they go off quite frequently. Also the wifi was a bit spotty, turning off at random times, but if you restart it, it usually comes back on, no problem. Additionally, I was there in winter and while there was a heater in the master bedroom, I didn't find one in the guest bedroom and it could get quite chilly at night."

The apartment is just as great as it looks in all the pictures - the apartment is nice and bright, and the balcony was perfect for a couple of afternoon drinks.

I needed to go UTS everyday - only a 15 min which is very convenient, and a great location to get to other funky suburbs like Newtown or Surry Hills.

Towards the end of my stay I realised I needed to extend my stay for a few extra days, and Thais was very flexible about that.  The apartment is in very good condition, clean and everything worked well.  I am really looking forward to staying here again next year.

The location is great and only a short walk to Town Hall station and if you fancy a little bit more of a walk then Central Station is not too far either. Everything is within walking distance \u2013 Hyde Park, Chinatown, all the bars in Surry Hills and Oxford St, Woolworths supermarket and more.\n\nI loved the look and feel of her home especially the d\u00e9cor and style. Considering how close it is to the city the area has a small town feel to it and Stanley Street has a really nice vibe too with plenty of restaurants to choose from. \n\nJacqui is very welcoming, friendly and a lovely host. She was so thoughtful too, helping me with my flat hunting and even introducing me to the neighbours and not forgetting a lovely little wine bar called Love Tilly Devine.\n\nThe room was just the right size and I was able to fit all my belongings including a large suitcase. Her entire home was very clean and tidy and I slept so well during my stay. Thanks for being a great host Jacqui!\n"

It is not strong, dog lovers wouldnt notice it im not used to having inside animals - need to keep door shut or else dog gets into your things.\nBut overall I was very happy with all else.\nCheers Jemimah\nShared w another couple at same time."

Thus, it is so easy to inform them about any concerns that they might be of help. \n\nTheir house in general is tidy and well-maintained, as per our room as a couple it was basically complete of what we need, since it was winter, the heater inside the room added comfort for us to get a restful sleep. There was also an easy access to the toilet & bath in our room. \n\nWe were initially booked to stay for 7 days for the Hillsong Conference and planned to transfer in CBD after but we opted to extend our stay for 10 days instead because of the family atmosphere that we felt & to save ourselves some time to transfer to another accommodation.\n\nTita Malou & Larrie became our parents in their sweet, humble & beautiful home in Sydney.\n\nFor us, their home is way better than what a hotel could probably offer. We will absolutely recommend to our friends or to anyone to stay in their home. If it's God will for us to come back in Sydney, we will certainly love and not hesitate to stay in their home once again.\n\nThank you so much, Tita Malou & Larrie for making our stay in Sydney the best that it can be!\n\nTil we meet again!\n\nGod bless,\nJeff & Edz"

Their home is only a block from the Great Western highway and we took only 30 minutes to get to Olympic Park in Homebush.  \nRail access is excellent... only 5 minutes by car to the station.\nThe aspect of the house is beautiful....on a hill in a quiet cul-de-sac. They turned the heater on before we arrived home so the rooms were warm.\nThey showed interest in us as individuals and as a group.\nWe attended Hillsong conference and didn't arrive until about 10 at night.  They were quite happy for us to come in and use the kitchen and shower at that time.\nWe have already recommended their home to many people."

The exhaust fan in the bathroom didn't work (no reply from John to two SMS) and there was no  rail or hook in the bathroom for towels, nor anywhere to put soap in the shower. John said he would refund the cleaning fee but this has not happened.\n\nAlso we were charged $199 more than quoted, which we tried to sort out with Cathy before arrival, to no avail. At checkout we showed John our paperwork and discussed it with him and he agreed we had been overcharged, said he was \"not trying to rip us off\", he would sort it out but to give him a couple of days to organise a refund. He also thanked us for leaving everything perfectly clean and tidy. After 8 days we have not heard from John or Cathy.\n\nThe flat was well-appointed with modern equipment but was not functional. The outside setting, while looking nice in the photo, is in an area at the back which is shared with two shops, a large number of rubbish bins, clothes lines, old household fixtures I presumed were ripped out of one of the flats and next door's dog."

It is a short drive to the city from Lane Cove, and if one is relying on public transport, a convenient bus ride away. This accommodation is ideal for someone who needs a peaceful environment."

They were always one step ahead.\nAnd we fell in love with Pip the dog :)\n\nThanks a lot to Jo, David and the boys."

The pass was around $42 for 7 days and meant you could use all forms of transport, from the end of the road, where Jo lives and around the CBD. The fridge was kept stocked with the essentials like milk and bread, which meant we didn't have to rush to the shops as soon as we arrived. We would recommend anyone to stay there.

It is a free-standing haven & even more appealing because it has it's own entrance way. You park your car out on the quiet street & the side entrance means that you don't have to actually walk thru their home.\nBeing brand new, our quarters felt like a very spick & span modern hotel ...but the garden setting & all the caring extras really made our stay.\nJo & David & sons are so lovely to talk to ......always helpful but never intrusive. David came to our rescue when we needed to take food to a 're-union get-together' & lent us an esky....we were already delighted that we had access to a full sized fridge near their Bar-b-que....we could therefore shop at Woolies the previous night & be prepared. We had lots of re-unions on this Sydney visit & our 4 nights at Jo & David's saved our sanity. We were within a few minutes drive to main roads that went in any direction, but Jo & David's home is off the beaten track & as quiet a sanctuary. The thoughtfulness was everywhere....toast & weetbix & plunge coffee waiting ....jams & butter & milk in the fridge. There is a blind on the window in the photo now, but it wouldn't matter ....you feel totally private & secluded anyway. Thank you Jo & David ...we loved coming home to roost & chatting with you all after your family Bar-b-ques...you have that special gift needed that makes folk like us feel totally welcome & at ease ....we would rave on & on, but we don't want you to be booked out next time we need you! We'll be back! Such a find!"

We stayed over Christmas and the place was beautifully decorated and lit at night, plus some lovely festive treats awaited us, so we felt like we were at home from the start.  So many things to do from here - kayaking, hiking, fishing, breakfast at Church Point,  lunch at Newport Arms, Patonga or just exploring the waterways locally.  If you want to just stay put and read, watch TV, listen to music, etc, the place is well set up for this with lots of little spots to hide in the shade or stretch out in the sun. The kitchen facilities are good (we managed to cook a full Christmas lunch)  You do need your own boat if you want to explore but this is the local mode of transport and there is a good jetty to tie up to. (or sit on with a glass of wine)  We thoroughly enjoyed our time and wish we could have stayed longer."

Turtle Run turned out to be the perfect setting. It's a stunning property perched amongst the most tranquil and sublime setting. Rob, the host, couldn't have been more accommodating.\n\nThe one thing to be mindful of with this property is that it's a $25 water taxi ride (each way) every time you want to get back to the mainland for meals or shopping. One night we ordered pizzas for $60 and then it cost another $50 to collect them. Truthfully it was worth it, but it's something to be mindful of."

There were 7 of us, the layout of property was perfect - great areas to all be together as well as perfect spots to be alone with a good book and a cup of tea.  We swam, kayaked, fished and went for walks. A boat would've been good, but not a necessity.\nA property so close to Sydney yet a million miles away from the hustle and bustle is a sanctuary indeed.

Also close to Waringah shopping Mall which has plenty of shops including DJ, Myer, a library and a cinema.\n\nFacilities - Plenty of storage with space in wardrobes and drawers. Well equipped kitchenette Fridge freezer, microwave, mini over/ toaster, crockery etc. Laundry facilities including washing machine, iron and airer  was much appreciated - especially when travelling with children!\nWe had our own bathroom with shower cubicle (no bath - which suits us) and hairbrush and straighteners were in cupboard if we needed them.\nWe had a good sized double bed in the bedroom and our 2 children slept in the lounge where there was 1 single bed and 1 sofa bed. (so you could potentially have 3 children sleeping there). All linen and towels were included and beds were made up on arrival.\nThere was a TV in the lounge and we enjoyed the Wifi access which helped greatly with our planning of trips etc.\nThere was a patio with a large dining set and BBQ which is available for use.\nWe stayed here for the Sydney NYE celebrations and booked tickets for Bradleys Head, but there is a viewing spot near Manly (North Head).\nOverall this accomodation had everything we needed and was great value for money. I would recommend this to other travellers who do not want to stay in the city and are looking for something suitable for a quiet stay.\nMairi"

The apartment is spacious, light and has good storage. The covered deck with patio furniture and bbq is large and has a distant sea view.

The BBQ on the deck with a view out to the ocean was a highlight, and the accomodation itself was very comfortable. Public transport is really convenient too, especially the rush hour express buses into the city.\n\nWe have a family of four - the kids slept in the bedroom and my wife and I shared the very comfortable sofa bed. \n\nIt was great having our own washing machine, and clothes dried quickly on the clothes horse on the covered deck.\n\nAll things told I'm very happy to recommend this apartment to fellow airbnbers! Great value and a warm welcome.\n"

Hodne se nam libil prostor, ktery sme meli k dispozici a taky terasa se stolem a stolickami byla naprosto skvela. Jedinym nedostatkem samotneho bydleni byla ponekud moc jednoducha kuchyn anebo spis jednom kuchynska linka v obyvaku. To je ale pro lidi stravujici se spise venku nepodstatne. Pobliz je autobusova zastavka, z ktery se da dostat do blizkeho shopping centra Warringah mall, taky do pristravu Manly a zridka premava i linka, ktera te odveze az do mesta. Jinak je potrebny prestup u spominaneho shopping centra nebo se projit 20 minut k hlavni trase vacsiny linek. Manly je nadherna oblast Sydney a sme radi, ze sme mohli jeden mesic bydlet prave pobliz teto vyhledavane oblasti. Allambie Heights je situovano na kopcech, takze okrem romantickych vyhledu treba myslet i na auto, ktere sme my hodne postradali."

I took my time composing this, to ensure Greg, Amy, and Laura receive the proper credit they deserve. The house could not have felt closer to home! It was pure heaven on earth, simply stunning. Each morning started with the most beautiful sunrise one could imagine, followed by a day of lounging in sunshine on the deck, quick strolls to my favorite beaches and dips in the sparkling pool below. Both Laura and Amy were most accommodating, lending their iMac charger to me numerous times throughout my stay. I can\u2019t forget, Vinnie, the house cat. Who is by far the sweetest and most intelligent cat I\u2019ve meet thus far. He was a doll to keep me company at all the right times. On the off days when the weather was not ideal, the wifi, dvd, and full cable access were lifesavers. Everything from the stunning wood paneled ceiling to the water temperature/pressure was just perfect! Even the laundry room is worth mentioning. The refreshing air conditioning system and toasty mini heater came in handy quite regularly. I would most definitely highly recommend a stay at Greg\u2019s gorgeous Tamarama home to anyone looking to create priceless memories. Many thanks\u2026 "

The apartment was clean, light and airy and had the addition of air conditioning which was needed whilst we were there. The views from the balcony over the coastline was spectacular and the pool was great for the kids when they didn't want to be on the beach anymore. I would highly recommend Craig's place to anyone wanted to be near the beach and as hosts they were great at communicating with us on our arrival. The apartment was very well appointed and had everything we could have hoped for, it felt very homely and that was nice after a long journey. "

And I am sure in summer the pool would be nice to use.\nA lady called Amy, was really promptly to answer our enquiries! Thanks Amy!\nOverall it's a nice place, you just need to know what to expect!"

Leigh can supply beach towels so you don't have to travel with you own, and even kindly provided a cool bag so we could have a picnic. Sitting on the terrace with views of the sea, it was not hard to imagine oneself in the Mediterranean instead of one hour north of Sydney, especially in the beautifully landscaped front garden.\n\nThere are wonderful cafes and restaurants in the area, and we left our favourite spots written in the guest (Website hidden by Airbnb) you like walking, the walk to and from Barrenjoey Lighthouse and along Palm Beach is just stunning. You can download the free app 'Sydway Walker'  and the Barrenjoey to Narrabeen Lakes section lists all the good walks in the area.\n\nThanks again for a wonderful stay!"

Anna's place is wonderful, very comfy, beautifully furnished and very well located to explore the city - just a very short ferry ride, with perfect view of the harbour bridge and the Opera House... Also, street parking was very easy (and free) at all times. We very much enjoyed our stay with Anna and would definitely recommend the place."

            "comments":"Our four weeks at Clovelly were very enjoyable in this bright, spacious, airy and comfortable accommodation. The three bathrooms were excellent for our two families and the gas barbeque proved invaluable for this time of year in Australia.  A range of stores and cafeterias were within easy walking distance as was Clovelly beach, a very safe, sheltered bay with additional swimming pool and part of a string of impressive coastal walks.  Larger beaches are within a very short drive. The host was consistently courteous and helpful and remained easily contactable should any significant issues arise (there were none).  We had no difficulty parking our two hire cars close by even on New Year's Eve.  Adjacent neighbours were friendly, welcoming and understanding. The property has an enclosed and private rear garden (with a gate to the park) in which to relax during barbeques.\nThe centre of Sydney is easily accessible by public transport from the nearby bus stop, the 339 bus goes to Circular Quay which is in close proximity to the Sydney Opera House and Royal Botanic Gardens and from which numerous ferries depart for the various attractions and suburbs.  We travelled quite economically to Manly to visit some distant relatives.  It is a nice location with a few impressive beaches of its own.  Of the larger beaches we preferred Maroubra which was about a twenty minute drive.  Nice for families and surfers alike and not quite as populated as one or two others.\nThe Blue Mountains range is a two hour train journey Central Station to Katoomba.  Very scenic (and hot in early January, take water bottles).\nTo organise trips further afield (Cairns, Kuranda, Daintree) we found a travel agent in the centre of Coogee (about 10m mins drive) very helpful in getting the best deal without hours on the internet.  For shopping we found Westfield East Gardens (about 20 minutes) very good, it has an extensive range of shops of all sorts and parking is free.  We found Bayswater Car Rental, King's Cross very good.  A sat nav is a must (understandably). Lots of happy memories."

We feel that the offer is absolutely great value, a beautiful place if you like to be in a green suburb near the bushland but still in Sydney and with connections to the city. What's more, our hosts were extremely helpful in every respect, and they shared the whole home with us, including the spatious living areas. So it didn't feel at all like having \"just\" a room. Finally, if you're looking for community (e.g. dinner together), they will be happy to offer it. After our time there, we already felt sort of home, which made it a bit sad to leave. In conclusion, we definitely recommend the place."

We enjoyed meeting and getting acquainted with Bob and Sue and part of the family that was visiting. We enjoyed the privacy of our own bathroom and toilet which we shared with a friend who stayed in another bedroom. It was nice having space in a separate refrigerator and use of the kitchen, family room and patios.  There is ample parking on the street and a bus stop for the city is at the top of the street.

The rooms are nice, the beds really confortable, the bath room is big and impressive. I would love to live in a house like that.\nLeonie is a wonderful host, she did take a lot of care about our little family and helped us with heaps of things even before we arrived.\nWe can recommend this place without ANY restriction."

Most of time,It's very difficult to find deep tub when we go (Website hidden by Airbnb) We felt really happy :) Could relax after long walking. The house itself is conveniently located (only a short walk from the train station and bus stop, with lots of fashionable shops and restaurants around). Leonie herself was very friendly,welcoming,helpful person. She provided grateful suggestions for sightseeing. Due to flight schedule,our arrival was about 9am,but she welcomed us in the early morning! Also when we left her house to airport,Called a taxi for us. We appreciate for her kindness. Her cat is really Cute and Charming,love you. It's a pity for only one night stay in Sydney. One day,We'd love to go the beautiful beach together :-) Leonie,Take care and all the best. I definitely recommend Leonie's place to anyone visiting Sydney."

Our room was immaculately presented with the factors of comfortably and cleanliness gives prominence to copious positive aspects of the room. The location itself, absolutely perfectly positioned! Countless cafes, shops and all the needs of a woman, man and child is within easy walking distance. In a quiet street, a stone's throw from the centre of everything and is perfect for walking around the town.  Leonie went out of her way to ensure that we were convivial and safe. She even made the bed for us, re-stock the supply of chocolates (YUM YUM!!!) and more. The ambiance and charms of Leonie's delightful home made our stay in Sydney one to remember. For a great price, very comfortable, perfect location and a wonderful host who will do anything for you (Leonie), what more do you want?! "

Imagine the thousand plastic greetings from manufactured chain hotels.  \n\nNow imagine this: a perfectly-located haven of peace, tranquillity, beauty and fun- yes fun!  \n\nThat is what Leonie's place was like.  Every detail was perfect: from the abundance of towels, to the big fluffy robes, to the thoughtful pitcher of water by the bedside, the hair dryer in the bathroom and the \"naughty\" bars of chocolate left next to the water.\n\nBut more important than all these details is the fact that this is Leonie's home- not just a house, but a home.  The warm scents, tasteful furnishings and the clear evidence that this is a place where people live gives it vitality that you just can't get in a hotel or even an ordinary B & B.  \n\nStaying with Leonie was very special.  If you are lucky enough to have the chance to stay, take it.  There aren't many places like this.   "

They weren't too loud but nonetheless the noise was disturbing. \nThe other point to note is that there is no unmetered parking in Bondi. The on street parking is quite expensive as are the parking stations. The nearest unmetered parking is about 10 minutes walk from the apartment. \nOtherwise our stay was very enjoyable and I'd recommend this apartment to anybody considering staying in Bondi because of it's convenient location."

Ursula is a prompt communicator, and requests for an early check-in and for holding on to our luggage while we weren't around was arranged for, all though text messages on AirBnB.\n\nThe bedroom was clean and well made when we arrived, and the WiFi, TV, kitchen and heating were all available and functional. Her welcome note left on the bed helped us with travel (the bus stop is a few meters away from the doorstep), local eateries and about using the washer (at no extra cost).\n\nWe would stay at her place again, and recommend the same to travelers who would like to stay close to CBD and the beach."

I am extremely glad to have made that decision! Jane's apartment is clean, comfortable and very inviting. I felt right at home, so much so that I spent an entire day lounging in bed, I had just completed a 10 day work period of 12 hour days in Melbourne and Jane's place provided me exactly the restful environment that I needed. She and her sweet little dog Bubbles are great company and made me feel quite at home. Highly recommended!"

On the plus side, it is sited in the centre of Surry Hills now the most trendy and fashionable suburb in Sydney. The house is roomy with two bedroom, a large living room , central garden space, patio and well equipped kitchen. Surry Hills is near everything in central Sydney. \nIts position was also a downside for us. A few metres from Crown street and the largest pub/bar in the locality it was always pretty noisy and particularly at weekends. We never opened our bedroom windows at night as they faced the street and the pub. Our neighbours liked to smoke on their patio and talk (rather loudly) to late in the evening. The curious architecture of the house meant that it sounded as though they were just outside our bedroom. We both wore earplugs throughout our stay and shut the doors Given it was summer this was a pity as it could be quite stuffy. \nThe house is split into two parts \u2013 a living area and a bedroom area. The office/study on entering the house is gloomy (outside window shaded) and we never used it apart from when needing a strong wifi signal. To move from each side of the house required moving between several locked doors which each had to be on the latch in order not to get locked out while inside the house. This was odd and sometimes tedious. A steep iron open circular staircase was the access to both bedrooms and the bathroom. Fine unless you had toddlers or elderly infirm guests. Finally, given the price of the rent and compared to many other places we have stayed, the fabric of the house was rather tired and shabby. It needed to be redecorated and old carpets etc to be dumped."

At the corner of Collins and Crown there is a very big and trendy bar - which, even on ANZAC day, wont be a problem. \nIn just 20-30 minutes you can easily walk into the city centre.

The accommodations are clean and comfortable. The location in Surry Hills is outstanding, just off Crown St, which is a lovely neighborhood in its own right.

A butcher shop, bakery, bottle shop and good coffee shop are a very short walk away and several good supermarkets are a short drive.

Craig is a very friendly, interesting person who makes you feel comfortable right away.\nThe room was clean and comfortable, the bed was perfect for me, there is lots of drawer and hanging space, the room has a large TV, and the bathroom is big.\nThe townhouse has everything you need for a business or vacation stay - wi-fi, washer/dryer, espresso machine, and a gorgeous Hungarian vizsla named Jasper.\nThe townhouse is close to Bourke, Elizabeth and Botany Sts so there are bus routes going everywhere and Green Square station is literally a 5-10 minute walk away. You can walk to Surry Hills in 15 minutes, to Oxford St in 30 minutes or downtown in about 40 minutes and Moore and Centennial Parks are only a 15 minute walk away.\nI will definitely stay there again and will be recommending Craig to friends and contacts."

Sadly, we had to leave abruptly as it turned into a zoo at night (November - enormous spiders and beetles) and our family couldn't stand it - we're obviously not compatible with nature!\n\nAdditionally, dog poo in the garden made it sadly unsuitable for our toddler, which was a real shame as it was idyllic and really caught the sun during the day.\n\nAll it needs is some filters on the air vents, blocking the gaps under the doors, and maybe a gate to stop the dog coming into the garden un-chaperoned.\n\nIf these issues could be resolved, I would have no hesitation in recommending staying here."

Our hosts were also really helpful in recommending their family doctor when our daughter was ill. The cottage is very well appointed and a really comfy home from home. The garden is lovely and was perfect for our 3 year olds to run around in. We also enjoyed being greeted by Leila, their very friendly dog, each day! The cottage is a very short drive from shops, good coffee and all that Manly beach has to offer. The beach is within walking distance if you don't have little ones in tow and no buggy! We wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Sunshine Cottage to others. Thank you for a great holiday!"

The cottage has lots of character and is well equipped with everything you need for  a comfortable stay. The garden is private, secure and safe for young children and a lovely size for playing games and entertaining. As we were in Sydney visiting family and friends it really helped that we could entertain at the cottage (we made very good use of the bbq area) as well as being close to Manly and the ferries to the city and to the beautiful beaches in the area. We would happily recommend staying at Manly Sunshine Cottage."

In der Bondi Road gibt es alle Gesch\u00e4fte f\u00fcr das t\u00e4gliche Leben und der Bus f\u00e4hrt direkt vor der T\u00fcr ab.

Der Weg zum Bondi Beach ist ca. 10 min und von da aus hat man die M\u00f6glichkeit auch andere tolle Str\u00e4nde zu entdecken. Der Weg an der K\u00fcste bietet einen tollen Ausblick, man kann joggen, walken oder aber auch einfach nur spazierengehen.\nLoretta ist eine super Vermieterin und steht immer mit Rat zur Seite und beantwortet alle Anfragen sofort. \nIch habe meinen Aufnethalt sehr genossen und fand das Appartement super. Ich kann es nur weiterempfhelen. Bndi bietet alles was man f\u00fcr einen perfekten Urlaub braucht. Ich w\u00fcrde es jederzeit wieder mieten."

It was great to be in the heart of the city and get a true taste of life in Sydney; this is what travel experiences should be about!  The house was very comfortable and we just loved the decor; especially the Japanese bath!  Both Felicity and Khalid were very attentive from the moment we took an interest in booking their house for our stay.  It was so thoughtful of Felicity to have left us some essential food items, which meant we literally walked in to what was to be our \"home\" for five days.  We were very well located to move about the city via foot, bus, and ferries - ferries being our preference!  There was a convenience store just around the corner and a choice of places to eat nearby.  For anyone with children, the playthings in Darling Harbour next to the Tourist Information Office, all just a ten minute walk from the house, were the best that we've seen anywhere!  \n\nWe thoroughly recommend this accommodation.  In fact, this experience has convinced us that hotels are not the way to go for any future trips!   "

I am sure it would have taken the same amount of time just to pay for the parking in the adjoining car park!! It really is so close to Darling Harbour and all the main transport options, not to mention the Power House museum, Ian Thorpe Aquatic Centre, Star Casino and more. I could go on but I think you get the picture! \n\nAside from the location, Felicity and Khalid are the perfect hosts. From the moment of booking, up until when we left, they were in contact with useful information and advice to make our stay as easy as possible. We have a 5 month daughter and it was great to be able to go away without having to bring everything with us.

She responded to emails promptly and the booking process was easy.  \nTheir house is a very modern, clean terrace that felt like a home away from home.  The location is fantastic; very close to Darling Harbour and transport to the city etc. We were able to use their cot, high chair and pram and Felicity left a very comprehensive list of instructions regarding the house including tips on where to eat, the closest amenities, emergency services and shopping places etc.  She even let us use their parking permit (have brother's in Sydney with a car). \nI would have NO hesitation in booking their house again and highly recommend this property!"

They were both very prompt with communication and instructions prior to arrival; probably one of the easiest \"check-ins\" I've ever had on Airbnb. The place itself is great. The house was spotless, well maintained and well-equipped. If you're visiting for something at the Sydney Convention centre, you won't find a place better than this one. Thank you both for a wonderful stay!"

Waking up to the coastal vista was lovely. I received prompt and friendly communication from Sarah who was welcoming and flexible with my arrival timing. She also gave me a great guide she put together with local tips and activities which i used. I know where I'd like to stay when I return to Bondi.

All the facilities, appliances and tools you will need are there. \n\nSarah is a wonderful host! Knowing ahead of time that she had to be out of town, she made detailed arrangements to ensure all things are smooth. Sarah is very caring and thoughtful and provided an all-inclusive information binder. \n\nThis is our first experience of airbnb, and Sarah surely gave us a fantastic impression.

It is their policy to give you your privacy, but when we needed help or advice Steven was always there instantly. We got to use their bikes because we don't have a car and when I had problems with a puncture Steven kindly drove me to several places to get it repaired. And it was a pleasure to talk to him, especially when he showed me around the garden.\nOtherwise, everything is exactly as in the pictures and description.\nSo this is the perfect place if you are looking for something idyllic and close to nature. But you should keep in mind that it is not very easily accessible without a car. Bike rides in the area are beautiful but require a certain level of fitness, public transport exists but service stops in the early evening. That said, I would love to return anytime."

Facilites include a kitchenette with induction grill and oven and a fridge - all new and well maintained. \n\nThe studio can be accessed through a private street entrance , and is situated in quiet neighbourhood (Maroubra). A short walk leads to the major trunk road of Anzac Parade, where a large number of buses go to and from Sydney CBD. It is also a short bus ride down the same road to University of New South Wales, so may be especially suitable for visiting academics, mature students or visiting parents. "

Whilst the bed was a foldout it was very comfortable and the kitchen was well stocked with cooking utensils so we could cook during our visit.\nIt is a quick 10 minute walk to Anzac Parade shops and supermarkets which was handy and it's within easy access to many bus routes leading to the city, Coogee Beach and Bondi Junction. It's also a 5 minute drive to Eastgardens Shopping Centre which we did most of our shopping at and an easy 30 minute walk to UNSW.\nAs the studio did not have washing facilities we used Newington Towers Laundromat nearby on Maroubra Rd.\nWe would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Sydney.

The quality and standard of accommodation however, was very disappointing and certainly did not reflect the price charged. \nThe foyer was dirty, messy and stank and had rubbish. \nThe apartment was clean and tidy, however it was quite uncomfortable and really badly decorated. There were creepy stuffed toys on the bed and littered throughout the apartment. Certainly not the kind of decor you would expect in an adult space or Newtown. \nThe double bed was tiny and really uncomfortable, you could feel all the springs. There is no way it would comfortably fit two adults, especially if either is over 6ft tall. My partner is and had to sleep on the couch.\nThere was no blinds or adequate curtains to block out the street light that sits out the front window and lights up the whole apartment. We had to put towels over the window to try and make it dark.\nThis property is grossly overpriced for the quality. It cost us close to $500 for 2 nights and I feel really ripped off. \nWe moved to another property in Newtown after this one tat was just as close to King st, gave us parking permits, was a whole house, with courtyard, king size bed, everything you could possibly need, plus wine and beer for half the price!! The only thing in the fridge of Druids was a dirty old jar of used tomato paste. \nUntil this property gets a facelift or drastically reduces the prie to reflect the very average quality, I would highly advise booking something else."

I just love this cute apartment right behind the main drag of Newtown, King St.  Only a hop, skip and a jump away from the pulsing heart of Newtown!  And boy, did I paint Newtown red that night!!!\n\nThe apartment had everything I needed, and was clean and cute. It was really nice to sleep up in the loft section and the bed was comfortable with nice sheets as well.  I could make a much needed strong coffee in the morning, but I didn\u2019t use the fridge as there was so much great food available at all hours on King St. I didn\u2019t need my car at all, and was so happy to get the onsite parking which is a real bonus in Newtown as its sooo hard to find parking there.\n\nAnd lovely Cheryl let me do a very late checkout free as the next people weren\u2019t coming in until late at night\u2026 So thanks for that, I needed a big sleep in!!! I had a real ball, and can\u2019t recommend this apartment and Cheryl highly enough\u2026\n\n"

Family friendly, convenient, clean, ocean views, very relaxed, free wifi, would have loved to stay longer, but maybe will be back for some more sun, sea and surf!

It was handy having a parking permit so that we could leave our car and wander around gorgeous Manly and take in the sites/beach. However, the apartment itself was a bit musty/mouldy (I'm thinking most apartments in Manly are this way because of the sea breeze and climate) but because we had our 4 month old daughter with us, I was extra conscious of it. \n\nThere was visible mould in the shower and the water didn't drain (which was a bit gross), and the sponges in the kitchen sink (to be used to wash dishes) were covered in mould as well. The bed sheets were all clean and fine, although the couch was quite musty, as were the curtains. The windows didn't have screens so at night time, it was a bit annoying to leave the windows open as the bugs would come in attracted to the lights. If we shut the windows, however, it would be too musty and so we had to kinda sit in the dark with the windows open a bit. \n\nHaving said all that, I think it would be a great place for a backpacker or a single person or young couple to stay, but it was a bit old/musty/mouldy for a young family."

The hosts provided us with a well-written, up-to-date guide with local activities, walks, restaurants etc, which we found to be really helpful. We enjoyed our visit to the Newport Arms and its Terrace Restaurant, and made more than one visit to Brother Albert, a cafe recommended in their guide! We dined out for meals rather than cooking, but basic kitchen equipment and a BBQ was provided. We really appreciated finding fresh milk in the fridge on our arrival, as well as coffee and tea and a few snacks. The apartment is a 10min walk to the beach and shops/restaurants and was pleasantly cool even on the very hot days we stayed. We would love to visit again!"

We loved Newport and it a good base for exploring the peninsula and the surrounding areas. West Head is a must and Palm Beach is beautiful. The Newport Arms is well worth a visit for the stunning views from the terraces at the rear.\nThe apartment itself is very comfortable and Anne-Maree and Malcolm are charming hosts. There were some nice touches to make us feel very welcome on arrival and the apartment was very homely so we felt like guests in their house rather than just visitors passing through. \nThanks Anne Marie and Malcolm for making our brief visit so memorable and relaxing, we hope to see you again next time we visit Oz."

The apartment is part of a larger house, but self contained. It really is a great space. The neighborhood is also very nice and easy to get to via the 389 bus. We took the 15-20 minute walk to Bondi Beach everyday where there are numerous restaurants and cafes. Julia tried very hard to get the wifi to work for us when the signal wasn't strong enough which would have been the only setback for our trip. Otherwise she is very helpful and communicates quickly!"

We found it a bit far to walk to the beach (my kids don't like to walk very far!) but it's a very short drive to Bondi.  It's also about 5 mins drive from Rose Bay Wharf, where we caught the ferry into Circular Quay, which is about 10 mins away if you get a direct ferry.  It was great having cooking and laundry facilities.  The apartment was quiet and clean.  The wifi worked well, which was handy.  We would definitely stay there again.  Thanks Julia :)"

The 389 bus is right down the street, which gives you access to Bondi junction (train) or takes you right into city.  Julia was also very attentive when I had questions. Make sure to eat at Shuk, cafe down the road."

The location of the key was confirmed by a phone call and Julia also called to check at the beginning of the stay to make sure that we had everything we needed. There was a laminated sheet of information left in the apartment covering things like rubbish, wifi internet etc. that was very helpful. Location to Bondi was great, there was also a bus stop at the end of the street Route 389 that goes to Circular Quay and passes Bondi Junction which was helpful as we used public transport. There was also a great cafe close by called Shuk, great for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Bed and linen was comfortable and the apartment was very clean. Definitely great value and a great stay.

There were plenty of interesting books, CDs, and movies available although we didn't have time to enjoy these. What we also liked was the lovely view from the lounge and bathroom. The only thing was the CDs and precious books etc were arranged on quite low shelves which were accessible by my baby, so we had to block these with luggages and boxes. In hind sight we should have just moved them to a high shelf and will definitely do so in the future. \n\nThe location is fantastic. It's very close to an array of amenities like the laundromat, shops, buses, and doctors. Many nice caf\u00e9s and restaurants on Hall street are a five minute walk away. Also the walk down to Bondi beach is quite short and easy.\n\nMary as a host was very responsive and easy to deal with. We had a hiccup at the beginning of our stay and Mary refunded for one night with no issues. \n\nWould definitely recommend. \n"

I like its convenient location (being near the Central station) and there are nice restaurants in the vicinity. The apartment was clean, stylishly decorated and well equipped as per listing and Mathieu was hospitable. Unfortunately, the air conditioner in one of the bedrooms did not function well and have to make do with the fan. Being used to sleeping in air-conditioning rooms in our home country (yes, we are spoilt), this was rather a discomfort to my friends who were using the room."

The bus station on Bondi Road is just a few mins walk from his house and the bus takes you in 5 mins to Bondi Beach and in 10 to Bondi Junction. Our room was very comfortable, clean and had an additional TV in it.

Bobbie was amazing in providing everything for us, we didn't want for anything. Will 100% stay there again."

The sun shines into the house all morning time and shines into our pleased moods. The mattress, sheet, pillows are very clean and soft. We never felt cool in winter.\n\nThere're no cockroaches, no mosquitoes, no mice, no dust, but exciting sunrises every sunny morning. The lovely wild birds flied into for food and played with my daughter every day. The environment is clean, fresh, comfortable, relaxed and makes me want to stay for my entire life.\n\nThis is an old style house and is maintained pretty well. Kitchen, bathroom, laundry room are working properly. We took hot showers, cocked genuine Australia beef steak, lamp steak, tiger prawns every day. The dishes are delicious, juicy, with the smell greeted everyone. \n\nWith our dear landlord, Bobbie's help, we visited 2 Australian public schools, 1 Montessori School, 1 church family day. The educations are quite different from those in my country. We stayed in Bobbie's another house at Mudgee, a beautiful small tidy town for 1 night. That's a traditional country house with 150 years history. \n\nBobbie is really good at traditional Australia food. The impressive roast lamb leg will never be forgotten in my life. We did enjoy it. Thanks a lot to Bobbie, for everything."

It's also easy to get into the city on an express bus which runs from Bondi Beach to Sydney Harbour.\n\nMariko and Jules are happy, easy going and helpful.

We had nice conversations and evenings with Jules and Mariko. On the other hand we had our privacy when we felt like it. Both helped us a lot with questions about Sydney and travel tips.\n\nThe location of the apartment in Bondi Beach is just perfect. It's a 5 minutes walk to the beach and the area is full of bars, restaurants and nice little cafes. We loved the vintage look of the apartment's interior. Everything was very neat, tidy and our sleeping room was quiet. Even though the room is relatively small, it was ok for us two. We could use the living room, the kitchen, the balcony and the bathroom.\n\nWe highly recommend Jules and Mariko for your short term or long term stays in Sydney! It would be great to meet them again."

At the same time it's the calmest place we could wish, there are only sounds of the waves, wind and birds - we forgot that we're in one of the biggest megalopolis of the world. The view, smells and sounds from the balcony can make this staying unforgettable at any weather. The apartment is lovely equiped by the beautiful antique furniture (we love your retro gas cooker!) and all the necessary for cooking in the kitchen, even a barbecue on the terrace. Rahel is a really great host, very friendly and interesting cosmopolitan person, provided us with all important info regarding the travelling to CBD and other parts of the huge Sydney city, Bondi area and local specifics while living there. We highly recomend this apartment for staying for nature and comfort lovers, all the more it's quite easy to get from there to another districts. We'd love to come back one day!"

The outside garden area was a bonus. The location was excellent with just a short walk to the beach and constant buses to the city.  Being a little advanced in years, they were also most appreciative of having Ainslie, who lives nearby, to call on in case of any problems or questions.

What, at first glance, appears to be an average neighbourhood is full of wonderful surprises: fantastic beach, great restaurants, lovely groceries, easy bus line to down town and around, amazing yoga studio above the reataurant, Barzura, on the beach- all in easy walking distance. You get a free yoga class coupon if you eat at Barzura- and we loved it. We saw whales- twice- on our last day.  There is an amazing coastal path to walk.  We fell I. Love with Sydney AND Coogee Beach,  An aside: Air BNB pricing can be confusing, with exchange rates, etc.  Make sure you are solid on the final cost through Air BNB before booking.  "

We enjoyed the spacious appartment, the vicinity to the beach, the beauty of the sites within walking distance, the closeness of all ammenites. Transit and taxis are very close..beside the beach.. Coogee itself is much better then staying downtown. \nA power walk to Bondi is beautiful- about an hour. My parents who are in their 70s also did it. ....sightseeing, picture taking etc- a wonderful 3 hours. \n\nWould we stay here again? YES!\nWould we recommend this place to friends and family? Yes.\n\nFelicity and her family were helpful and availbel to assist and all was terrific!!\n\nWE had an amazing time and are very grateful to the Australians who made us feel so welcome....if you are a walker...indulge in the great baking form the local bakeries and cafes...worth the calories."

My parents were greeted by Felicity's brother-in-law upon check-in, who was friendly and helpful.\n\nThe apartment is centrally located and has an airy and peaceful feel. The kitchen is well-equipped plus there are lots of tasty food options in the neighbourhood. I can recommend \"Kiwi Style Fish and Chips\" in Coogee plus \"Chat Thai\" in Randwick, both less than a 10 minute stroll away. Those keen on homewares might fancy visiting \"Lived in Coogee\", another local gem.\n\nAt the end of a long day, it was a treat to curl up in the crisp white sheets. The master bedroom is particularly snazzy, with wonderful bedside lamps. I would certainly recommend Felicity's apartment to anyone craving a breezy, cheerful coastal getaway."

She made the apartment available to us for an early check-in. The studio is in a very nice location within 5 min. walk of Eveleigh Saturday Farmers' Market, 5 min. from the University of Sydney, 10 min. from Broadway Shopping Center. It has all the amenities you could need: nice bathroom and shower, comfy bed, nice couch with flat screen tv and cable, wireless internet, small kitchen with microwave, stove, toaster, etc. And Kellie and her husband were very helpful in guiding us to great areas to see in Sydney. Overall, it was our favorite Airbnb experience and we strongly recommend it."

From a good shower to a good meal to a good sleep, the studio provided so much comfort and rest. It's in a quiet neighbourhood yet it's also some quick walks to the coolest streets. I had a great time exploring Redfern St and King's St in particular. I'm really glad I managed to catch the artisan's market too. Too many quirky cool stuff! The hosts--- Though Kellie and family were also away, she provided good information and timely correspondence. She helped in whatever ways she could to make sure I could get around easily and that I could visit places I want to. Due to my own negligence, I locked myself in on the last day.. I was so panicky and was rather to jump over a few fence (my flight was in 2 hours) but Kellie solved the problem for me quickly with a neighbour's help."

They provided us with fresh orange juice, fruit, toast etc when we arrived. This was a great start. Kellie supported us with useful hints for NYE and was available any time we had questions. And she has geat children :-)\nThe appartment is really well-thought-out, lovingly equipped and clean. We did not miss anything. We could even use the garden and the washing machine. The Darling Studio is located close to Redfern station and maybe a 30 mins walk to the harbour. You have supermarkets, cafes etc in this area so it is easy to equip yourself with food and other stuff you need.\nWe would recommend the Darling Studio to all who are looking for a nice, uncomplicated, relaxed stay in Sydney and who set value on cleanness and great hosts."

She even made sure we had milk and provisions in the fridge on arrival!\nThe bed was really comfortable and we slept really well. Lovely touches such as hotel style white towels and fresh linen as well as toiletries in the bathroom. To be honest this was the best place we have stayed during our whole trip, as Kellie could'nt have done more to make us feel at home.\nI can't recommend this place enough, It is slightly 'bijou' but that is part of it's charm. After long days sightseeing it was a perfect place to come back to, feeling like a little retreat in the middle the city! Redfern is a really great suburb too - fantastic location to the main train station (2 mins walk away) with some great value cafes nearby, a good variety of shops and a great yoga studio called 'House of yoga'. Thanks again Kellie!\nJulia & Neil x"

            "comments":"Home! This is what I said when I came back to the studio after having being away for a couple of weeks.\nThe Studio has its own personality and it conquers you! It is very tastefully furnished, clean and very well equipped with anything you would need, even for a long stay. But is not merely this that renders it unique and special: it is its positive atmosphere, there is  a light and airy feel, warmth and brightness all around. Kellie also leaves fresh greenery in the studio and this together with the rest makes it enjoyable. \nKellie is a very thoughtful and proactive host, I do not know if this is because of her experience or if it\u2019s just her natural aptitude, but she usually anticipates any need you may have and is ready to help when asked. And she is also very honest, too. She understands what it means to be very far from home so she is particularly attentive and sensitive and you really feel that you can count on her. She is flexible, she understands your tastes and personality and adapts to them. She is not at all nosy or pushy and she leaves you a lot of privacy. \nThe studio is located in a safe and quiet lane, less than 5 minutes\u2019 walk from Redfern train Station so it takes you 10 minutes to get to the City. And if you work at the Sydney Uni as I did, it\u2019s only a 5- minute walk! There are shops and very nice caf\u00e9s within walking distance, too, and the neighbours are friendly and quiet.\nI have only mentioned Kellie, but I can say the same things about Amir, Kellie\u2019s husband who has been wonderfully kind and helpful, too. One last word about their children, truly wonderful, very affectionate, polite and not at all rambunctious. \nIt took me a while to write this review because I know that if one doesn\u2019t say something bad, people won\u2019t believe you\u2026 but I could not think of anything bad, in fact, I can\u2019t say enough nice things! If I had to come to Sydney again, there is no doubt in my mind, I would come here again\u2026 or come to think of it, perhaps it would be better if I say something bad about the studio, otherwise I may not find it available the next time \u2026"

I can't believe that all those nights have already flew by. \n\nThe first day when I arrived at her house she asked if I would like to join her to have a walk and showed me around the neighborhood. The bus stop, grocery stores, Coogee beach and etc. \n\nThe city is just one bus ride away as well as the Bondi beach and junction. Coogee beach is in walking distance. I had no trouble getting around without a car. I recommend the 3hour slow slow walk to Bondi beach from Coogee beach along the coast line. If you don't rest as much as I did it will take faster than 3hours. \n\nShe has also introduced me to some of her neighbors at the dog park including their gorgeous dogs. Of course the best dog in the neighbor was her lovely sweet friendly Anoush :). If you are a person who likes pets, I am sure you will love her as well. \n\nShe was always friendly to ask if I needed anything at the same time respected my own privacy when needed as well. It was always nice having a chat with her time to time. Shushann and her doggie Anoush both are just so friendly and lovely. \n\nI thank her for making feel like I was at home and hope to see her again if I have the chance to."

It is perfectly located, in Darlinghurst, in the middle of the city, yet on a quiet street with many restaurants to choose from just minutes away.\nThe staff was very helpful and straightforward when it came to check-in and -out times and everyone was extremely friendly and nice all the time.\nWhen we come back to Sydney, we'll definitely return to Apartment One."

The place is in a fantastic location with many amazing restaurants (fantastic coffee!) and the markets only a 5 minute walk down the road. Hugh was a fantastic host providing us with info as to where to go out to eat and also keeping in touch to see how we were travelling. I will definitely be staying here again.

Stylish apartment with cozy chill out couches, a fully equipped kitchen and a large dining table perfect for outstanding evening dinners (with fresh seafood from the nearby organic supermarket). The apartment is a converted dance studio and the tall mirrors on the sidewall make the large \u201cloft-like\u201d room optically even larger. Plenty of space for luggage and clothes storage, even washing machine, dryer and iron are provided. The cozy bed is a big bunk bed accessible by a small ladder, which is easily to climb (even after a long night out). A second full sized bed is hidden in the living room (but we didn\u2019t use it). The apartment is located a stone\u2019s throw away from a metro station. All needed facilities (cafes, supermarkets, etc.) are just around the corner. The location is right in the middle of Sydneys club scene at Potts Point, but night noise was not a problem at all (just usual sounds of urban downtown areas). The apartment is perfectly located for walks or evening dinning tours to Sydney\u2019s hipster areas Surrey Hills and Darlinghurst. To Townhall or Circular Quay (harbour) it is just a short metro ride, or a nice walk. We highly recommend this extremely well organized and top located design apartment. In combination with Hugh, one of the best and most helpful hosts you can get, this accommodation is fantastic. Rating: 11 stars out of 10. We would come back any time !!"

The tree lined street and its bird life were lovely, and we enjoyed the proximity to trains and great businesses such as Messino, Harris Farm Market, Apollo, Potts Point Bookshop, and the great croissant shop just along from the fire station in Victoria Street.  We found the proximity to the night club next door a little too noisy at times. . especially as the patrons drifted out onto the street in the early hours of the morning.   Hugh was a wonderful host, who we felt an affinity to, and whom we could ask for help at any time.  "

It is very easy and fast to get to the CBD, but you also get to stay in a tranquil place.\n\nThe cottage is well represented by the pictures on the ad, and is very cozy and inviting. Sue and Ian are warm and gracious hosts who are quick to offer advice or lend a hand with whatever questions you have.  They even accomodated our request for an open-ended departure date.\n\nYou won't be disappointed. Especially when compared to a similarly priced hotel room, this is a great value."

You are just a short walk away from the beach, although you can see the Pacific from the windows in the kitchen. The guest's room is more than enough room for someone staying just a few days or several months. The closet is large, and there is a nice desk to get some work done. I really appreciated Ruth's generosity and joyful spirit each day. She was a wealth of information about local hangouts and places to see. I will sincerely miss my time in Bronte. "

For my visit to Sydney I was looking for something that was relaxed, was close to the beach, and with good company and I wasn't disappointed. Ruth was a great host with suggestions for things to do or look into based upon my interests. We cooked for each other a few times and even met out for dinner in the city, as well. Ruth's place is about a 10-15 minute walk to Bronte Beach and I grew to love it and its salt water pool the best of all the beaches. Getting to the rest of Sydney is a breeze from Ruth's place, as well."

Balmain itself is full of wonderful caf\u00e9s, restaurants , pubs, shops and open spaces. We loved the architecture of the houses in this area and were envied by friends and family that we were staying in this most desirable area I sydney. Had a fantastic view of the firework display on NYE in the local Mort Park - not to crowded but great atmosphere. (Thanks to recommendation from Bronwyn) Without a car it was easy to visit many attractions - not only in the city but beaches to the north and south. Would definitely recommend a stay in this wonderful house.  "

            "comments":"Nan's room was very nice. It was a 20-30 minute walk down to Bondi beach and very close to a shopping center. The parking was a restricted on her street to 1 hour parking, except overnight, so you had to move your car in the mornings. This wasn't bad as it got us out of the house and seeing Sydney early. \n\nThere was unrestricted parking one block toward the beach, on the street that parallels her's. If you just walk out her door and do your best to keep in a straight line you will run into the street. I did feel lucky to find a space on it though. I didn't find it until the last day of our stay, so hopefully this will help someone out.\n\nThe house had a California open bungalow feel, if you made it into an apartment. Open windows (though the mosquitoes only got in through the front door by some twist in Australian logic, so as long as that wasn't left open). No internet, unfortunately. \n\nOverall a good value for the location. A far better deal than a hotel."

Beautiful spacious rooms with high ceilings, nice wooden floorboards. The kitchen was well equiped; it was easy to make our daily green smoothie. The area has a lot of art deco construction if that appeals: we like it.\nVery close to the immense shopping area of Bondi Junction, trains to the city, bus to the beach. It's also quick to get to the airport, which we were glad of at 5am. Thanks Nan for making your nice home available to us. We recommend it."

The apartment itself was beautiful and very clean and had a very nice feel to it. The court yard was the biggest I have ever seen, lots of room and very nice just to sit outside and have breakfast and lunch. The Host Nan was just a lovely woman who made us feel at home and has a very nice down to earth nature. We hardly saw her in the week we stayed with her.

The house was exactly as advertised; spacious, comfortable, clean, and full of amenities. Our experience could not have been better. There is a small market, butcher, bakery, and several cafes/restaurants within walking distance. Kristen was in constant contact with us during our entire stay with helpful suggestions and answers to my questions. She even had me look through her office to borrow an electrical adapter so that I would not have to buy one. We made full use of the well equipped kitchen and laundry room. I highly recommend this property. It was as nice as being at home while visiting an exciting foreign country (we are from the US). If we return to Sydney, we will definitely check first on this property."

Their home was excellent for our large family , it was clean, comfortable and is in an excellent location north of the city. The house has large comfortable living areas and a great outdoor entertaining / bbq area which we enjoyed.

We were also  able to walk to a local cafe for lunch  one day and the local IGA is also a short 10 min walk. The walk is  very pretty with beautiful birds, plants and trees to enjoy along the way.

About a 5-10 minute walk to the beach, and another 5 minutes or so into the heart of Bondi Beach town.  Unlike some other AirBnB places that are solely rental properties, this is someone's primary residence that's rented when they are away or on holiday.  Translation, their personal belongings are there and the home is lived in.  We've stayed in others similar, so no big deal for us.  The only catch, was the 2nd bedroom is their son's room and decorated accordingly.  We stayed in that room, while another couple took the master.  Overall though, we really enjoyed the stay here.  Excellent wifi, full stocked kitchen, nice bathroom, and apartment stays relatively cool with fans and no AirCon.  Hosts also left helpful tips around surrounding area and offered up his surfboards for use.  Would stay again and recommend to others."

Lucy had prepared everything really thoughtfully to make sure we had everything we needed, and everything was just perfect. \n\nIt was a great base to explore from, but we also had a few evenings just cooking and sitting on the balcony chilling out with a glass of wine and admiring the view over the water. \n\nThe area itself is fantastic, with loads of 'Timeout's best' bars, delis, bakeries, coffee shops and restaurants, as well as a good yoga studio nearby. Walking, it's about 20 minutes to Darlinghurst (around 25 to Oxford St down Darlinghurst Road), and about 30 mins walk to the CBD, as well as a short walk to Beare Park, and only 15 mins walk to Kings Cross to get the train and go further afield. This was our first Airbnb experience, and it exceeded all expectations. We'll definitely be back to stay the next time we're in Sydney (we're already planning the next trip)."

It was not 'dirty' as such, but it was fairly dusty and obviously hasn't had a thorough spring clean for a while."

There are a range of places on the doorstop to get food if you don't fancy cooking yourself.\nThe only disappointment is the size of the communal pool which was more of a plunge pool than a lap pool however this wouldn't stop me highly recommending the place.

The hosts, especially Kieren who welcomed us, were very kind to explain all the workings of the apartment. There were 6 of us, and we stayed very comfortably for 3 nights. The kitchen was well stocked with basic needs, and they threw in a bottle of champagne for us to enjoy! The bathrooms all had clean towels, and Aesop products. The rooms were all quite spacious, and the neighborhood were very central. Check out the Infinity Bakery, and All Spices right across the apartment when you get hungry. Oh a note on the air conditioning however, it didn't really get cool for the master bedroom, but we didn't make a big fuss due to our short stay. But I'm sure they will work on it very soon! All in all we had a great weekend in Sydney and can't wait to get back, and will check out their other places too!"

The apartment is well equipped and even nicer than it appears in the photos. There is no wi-fi so bring a flashdrive or plan to use an internet cafe in the neighborhood. I made quite a few trips on the ferry coming and going from the CBD/Darling Harbor so definitely purchase an unlimited transport pass when staying here."

Ample room, over three levels, everything was very clean and comfortable. \n\nWe would definitely stay again- our host was very friendly and easy to organise details of our stay with.

This room was better/just as good as any hotel rooms we have had.\n\nThe room is light, sunny, clean and well equipped with everything you could need, in a beautiful and safe building. \nThe rooftop pool is incredible, as is the view of the Sydney Harbour.\nLocation is great, close to city so cabs are cheap and it is 2 minute walk to the train station. \n There is lots of restaurants and take aways about, as well as a supermarket and convenience stores. The bed is super comfy, and though the apartment is in a very busy area, its on a quiet-ish street, so there is no traffic noise or loud neighbours so we slept soundly. Sydney is a very busy place so its nice to come back to a peaceful place where you can relax. The bathroom is clean and well equipped, with a good hot water system and a beautiful view of the Sydney Harbour.\n\nWe have nothing but good things to say about this place, in fact we cant wait to come back!!\nHighly recommended."

            "comments":"Hi, I booked Max's little studio for a French friend who was planning to stay 3 nights in Sydney. Since it was his first visit to Sydney, he wanted to be in the \"centre\". \nMy friend was delighted. The studio is ideally located to discover Sydney. Darlinghurst is extremely lively and you are almost in Potts Point (5 minutes walk). Elisabeth Bay, the Opera House, Woolloomooloo, Royal Botanic Garden, the CBD, Circular Quay etc are in a walking distance but you can also elect to take the train (Kings Cross station is 150 m from the studio) or a bus. Also, at the Corner of Oxford Street and Darlinghurst road it is easy to catch a bus to go to Bondi Beach or Bronte.\nI was happy that the studio, located on the 4th floor, is quiet (not on the street side). It is also clean, tidy and... the view on the roof top is absolutely fabulous... and the swimming pool stylish.\n... Un endroit fabuleux pour organiser un aperitif \"avec vue et autour de la piscine\". \nMax was extremely friendly and helpful. For example, it was easy to organise an appointment to check in and out.\nI will recommend this place if you are looking for a little pad (and a decent price) from where you can explore Sydney and discover his lifestyle. A great alternative to an hotel room.\n\nKind regards. \n\n- version fran\u00e7aise -\nBonjour, j'ai r\u00e9serv\u00e9 ce petit studio dans un immeuble \"art d\u00e9co\" pour un ami fran\u00e7ais qui voulait s\u00e9journer au centre de Sydney et d\u00e9couvrir la ville pendant 3 jours. Mon ami \u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 ravi. La situation est id\u00e9ale, dans un quartier vivant (Darlinghurst) \u00e0 5 minutes de Potts Point. \nDepuis le studio on peut ais\u00e9ment partir \u00e0 la d\u00e9couverte de la ville \u00e0 pied (Elisabeth Bay, the Opera House, Woolloomooloo, Royal Botanic Garden, the CBD, Circular Quay etc), mais on peut aussi d\u00e9cider de prendre le train (Kings cross Station est \u00e0 150 m) ou le bus (par exemple si on veut aller vers les plages de Bondi et Bronte, il est possible de prendre le bus \u00e0 l'angle de Darlinghurst street et Oxford Street) . \nLe studio, situ\u00e9 au 4e \u00e9tage, avec ascenseur est calme (ne donnant pas sur la rue assez anim\u00e9e le weekend) et le toit-terrasse avec sa piscine est id\u00e9al pour un ap\u00e9ritif avec vue \u00e0 360 degr\u00e9s sur les lumi\u00e8res de la ville, l'Op\u00e9ra et le Harbour Bridge... \nMax est tr\u00e8s sympathique et tout s'est pass\u00e9 simplement (rendez-vous pour prendre et rendre les clefs, etc). \nJe recommande cet endroit si on recherche un petit endroit, propre et accueillant, d'o\u00f9 partir explorer la ville, le tout \u00e0 un prix acceptable. C'est une excellente alternative \u00e0 une chambre d'h\u00f4tel."

Yes rooftop pool where you can see the opera house and the bridge - what more could you want.  The apartment was really clean and the towels were to die for i.e. we have been away for so long and never had such fluffy towels.  I would recommend everyone who goes to Sydney to stay here.  Great coffee shops and restaurants nearby and more more than a 20 minute fabulous walk to the Opera House.  Will stay again when visit Sydney."

We chose this apartment as it is conveniently located from Train station/Bus stop and local grocery stores and eateries.\nI personally liked the way the apartment was done up and it was perfect for our small family of three. \nWe were landing at Sydney late at night and Antoinette made sure that the keys were available to us even at that time. She was generous to keep some snacks for our breakfast the next day and had left detailed instructions on how to go about common chores. Coming in from an international flight and with a child, this was really useful. She made herself accessible for any questions that we had and was quick to revert. \nEverything in the apartment was exactly as described - a well equipped kitchen, TV, beds, washing machine, dryer, internet access, linen, etc\nWe would definitely recommend this place to our friends. Thanks Antoinette."

She was kind to leave us a welcome pack with much more than the basics.\n\nWe found the apartment basic. We experienced it unbearably warm with inadequate ways to cool ourselves down.  We needed to keep the windows open which inhibited our privacy. Two of the Windows required both of us to open them by wedging cardboard in either side to keep it open. The water system is old and the water slightly brown the majority of the time, we therefore didn't feel comfortable drinking it or using it for hot drinks but it was ok to wash with. \n\nThere is a great public pool, small park and ice-rink 5 minutes walk away.  The train station is about 10 minutes walk away with frequent trains.  There are mostly Asian shops on the high street so it was great to meet the locals however it is mostly a poorer area so the restaurants were inexpensive but being vegetarian we found it hard to find ones to meet our needs."

Clean & nothing short of perfect! The pool is heated and we jumped in early morning to have a little swim and we were greeted by beautiful birds landing on the pool railings!\n\nMaryellen was very respectful by leaving us to our own devices yet if we needed the internet password or an extra pillow it was done in a flash! \n\nLovely breakfast which we prepared ourselves, including beautiful fruit, Juice, Crossants & cereal. \n\nWe are coming back in 5 weeks and without a doubt this will be our place of call. \n\nThanks Again Maryellen & John"

Everything was working great, amenities are modern and brand new, our privacy was guaranteed, we could have a bbq anytime and a swim whenever we wanted. Also, it was great that it's a just a small walk from the house to the train and 10 minutes to the beach. This holiday will most certainly be one of most memorable ones for us and big thanks for that to Maryellen and John, our now friends."

It is a perfect 5 star studio room with all the privacy you need with access to a private swimming pool. There is a private entrance and we will be on our own. The best value for what I have paid. The house is at a tranquil location on the foots of Royal National Park at Kirawee. On a rainy day, you feel like you are at a hill station. At morning the birds will wake you up at 7.30 AM and in the nights you will hear crickets. A true bush stay experience. You get the home as you see in the photographs and won't find any spots in the home. John and Maryellen are perfect host. On the day of my arrival, they welcomed me with a drink and offered me a ride to show around the suburbs. The studio kitchen has serials and other supplies for your breakfast. For other light cooking, they had a electric pan. Also please be aware the home is 14 minutes walk from railway station and  if you are not used to walk, it will be difficult. But for us it is OK. I will definitely recommended it to my friends.\n\nAnd thanks to John for dropping me over the station on my check out. It is a very memorable stay and thanks a lot.\n\nSince John and Maryellen don't have much experience in using Sydney public transports, I would like to give some ideas\n\nIf you are coming from overseas and want to go to Kirawee, there are two options\n\n1) Get a train ticket to Kirawee. It is not a direct train. You have to go to Wolli creek and change at Wooli creek. This may be the direct way, But I wouldn't recommend it for two reasons. One, there is a airport railway station access fee of $15 and it would be costly for someone who is on their limited budgets. Secondly between 4.00 PM to 6.00 PM there are no trains to Kirawee that stops at Wolli Creek station. Otherwise it is OK.\n\n2) The other way around is, get a 400 bus that goes to Burwood and get down at Rockdale. The bus stop at Rockdale is in front of railway station. And get a train to Kirawee from Rockdale. I would recommend to get a myzone 2 or 3 ticket for a week/ month if you don't have your own car. The ticket will give you unlimited travel on Sydney suburbs except airport stations on train, buses including airport stations and all ferries for the period of one week / month based on your purchase. The tickets are available at the railway station counter at the airport. But please mention you don't need station access while purchasing for this option.\n\nPleas feel free to contact me if you need any information.\n\nCheers\nMurali"

Both myself and more importantly my father were delighted with the standard of accommodation. It's the perfect home away from home, quiet, tranquil, relaxing and beautifully furnished with all the essentials and little extras such as breakfast cereals supplied. The accommodation has its own private entrance from the pool and deck area. This is a lovely place for an early morning cup of coffee overlooking the beautiful bush land of the national park and the pool is perfect for a refreshing dip after a long day of sight seeing. Maryellen and John were the perfect hosts not only to my father but also to both myself, my sister and our families. They were more than happy for us to visit with our children in tow and make use of the fantastic pool.

We enjoyed having breakfast alfresco!\n\nHaving lived in this neighbourhood and now back again as visitors, we know Jennifer\u2019s place is one of the loveliest places you could stay."

Short walk to bus stop to take you into the city, or about a 20 minute walk. Close to shops and bars of Kings Cross. \n\nWe experienced a couple of small issues during our stay, but David was very quick at checking up and resolving them. \n\nThere was construction work going on at the rear of the property which started early, luckily we are early risers. That work is due to be finished by mid-October. Aside from that, the area where the apartment is is VERY quiet and totally relaxing, considering how close you are to everything.\n\nI would not hesitate to stay at this property again the next time I am in Sydney. Thanks for a great trip!"

The apartment was fitted out with everything one could possibly need for a long stay. David had lots of items that are needed in a kitchen when you first arrive and that was great, especially as our flights were late and we arrived around 9 o'clock at night.  It is situated in a very handy location to everything you need to do in Sydney.  Walking distance to Kings Cross Station and buses and taxies. The apartment was clean and easy to keep tidy whilst we stayed there.  We were very comfortable here and I would recommend it to any family or group for a long stay."

The AirBnB experience and The Chee Bondi has meet all my expectations.\nOur host Eamon was friendly and relaxed, accommodating and flexible. He showed us to our room, ran thru the basics and answered all our questions\nThe room, which is actually self contained with a separate kitchen and bathroom, was well appointed, spacious, tasteful, and very clean. Free WiFi is offered, a nice complementary bottle of white wine was sitting in the fridge....and there was a powerful hairdryer for my girlfriend!\nLocation really was a star of this story. It was literally a 3 minute walk, cross Campbell Parade and you're at Bondi Beach. Restaurants, bars, banks, corner stores are all within a 100meters.\nAnyone who knows Bondi knows how hard parking can be to find. Chee Bondi offer a dedicated car space for the room that is off the street and gated which was invaluable.\nI have good travel experience and I would rate this accommodation. It was a comfortable, relaxing and very easy experience. Thanks Eamon...I will be back"

The apartment was perfect for what we needed... Self contained it had a fully equipped kitchen, nice clean bathroom and comfortable bed. And the location is amazing! It's about a block from Bondi beach and surrounded by numerous restaurants, cafes, and bars. The post office is practically next door and the local supermarket only a minute or two up the road. Best of all the apartment is situated off the street front so we didn't find noise level to be an issue at all.

Eamon always replied to all my questions very promptly. Actually The Chee Bondi was the only place not charging any cleaning fee unlike other places. Even though the room rate was so reasonable, it was very conveniently located in the middle of cafes, restaurants and shops and only 1 minute' walk to the beach. Also very easy to catch a bus to Bondi Junction for shopping at the Westfield shopping center. Since #6 was at the rear of the building, we were not bothered by the street noise at all. It was exactly like the photos with very detailed amenities. A bottle of wine made us feel really welcomed. Kitchen was well equipped and everything we needed was there. The place and all the linens were super clean. WiFi and the coin operated laundry (on the ground floor) were handy.

The house itself is beautiful as is the surrounding area. Its quiet and the area is very safe. As for the train station it is less then 5 min walk from the house but just a little note on that. The area, like a lot of Sydney is hilly, and from the driveway to the train station its a steep hill upwards, going back to the house is great, all down hill. I would absolutely recommend both Askar as a host, his house and the street that the house is located in. Getting into the city is so simple and for a week of travelling on train, bus and ferry i recommend the zone three unlimited ticket for $61. It is fantastic value. On the way to Wynyard which is the best station to get off as it is so central and just a walk to Circular quay one way and the other way a walk to darling harbour. Again train related on your way to Wynyard I would highly recommend you stop at Chatswood and visit the Westfield shopping Centre, Its an excellent place to spend a day. Back to Askar and the house, this is the first time i was using Airbnb and I would recommend it to anyone, in fact has encouraged me to become a host aswell and that is down to Askar himself, so i cant give any higher praise then that."

Askar was very helpful throughout our stay, he was present as we needed him but we definitely felt like it was a stand alone home for our family to enjoy. \n\nThe neighborhood is accessible by car and train to the best Sydney has to offer. The comments others made about the driveway are true - the parking space in particular is hard to navigate but parking on the street is an option for those who find it too intimidating. \n\nThe main bedroom is large with a walk in closet - plenty of space for my wife and I and a pack&play/port-a-cot. The second room was great for our older two kids. \n\nLiving space was great to relax in and the deck and the glass doors were a real added enhancement. \n\nThe downsides were very minor - the kitchen only has the essentials, the dryer takes a long time to dry clothes,  and there's no bathtub, only a shower. \n\nOtherwise a perfect listing with a wonderful host!"

            "comments":"We moved from the Netherlands to Australia and needed a furnished accommodation until we had our own home and our own furniture to arrive. We stayed at this place for a month. Because it\u2019s not a holiday for us because we now are actually living in Australia, we were using the rental differently than if you are staying for a shorter time and just using it to sleep. So everything had to be working well because we were using it as our own home.\nAskar told us while showing the place, that due to flooding caused by rain, the floorboards were bent slightly. Due to the flooding there was a lot of humidity in the house that causes a certain smell that got in your clothes, sheets and everything. The many rainy days didn\u2019t help either. There is only sun on a small part of the balcony in the morning so if you want to wash you have to do that on a sunny day because otherwise it won\u2019t dry. The dryer is not working, the first time I used it I put in my sheets and it took the hole day in the dryer and it still was not dry. The dryer tumbles but it just doesn\u2019t dry. Askar mentioned it does work but it stops when it\u2019s hot and after cooling down it works again. In my opinion it\u2019s not working. We had to put on a heater to make sure we could use the sheets on our bed. There was a second pair of sheets but they were smelly because of the humidity, we didn\u2019t feel like using them.\nThe surrounding of the house is stunning, looking out the window you have a stunning view. Askar the host (we haven\u2019t met Zara) does everything to make you comfortable. At first the internet was very slow and the TV wasn\u2019t working properly but Askar fixed that, although it took almost 1,5 week before the TV was repaired. Parking at the place is a bit scary if you aren\u2019t used to driving in the hills like us. (The Netherlands is a very flat country). If you want to leave the place you have to be lucky the one public parking place is free so you can make a scary turn otherwise you have to go up the hill in reverse. \nIf you don\u2019t come by car you can use the train and bus, both close by but you have to take a long steep road to the top."

Everything is brandnew and Felicity has done a great job creating a space that feels cozy, modern and like a real home. The location was the best surprise: on a map you might get the impression that it is far out. However, the cottage is right on the Manly to Spit Walkway and the walk to Manly Wharf could not be nicer. Our kids never wanted to take the bus! We wanted to explore Sydney and found the cottage to be the perfect hub. You either take the ferry or a direct bus to the city. Back 'home' you enjoy the numerous beaches, the quiet, the peace. Last but not least Felicity, David and their two boys were great - one could not wish for better hosts. Our girls would suddenly vanish and we would find them somewhere in their spacious garden. If our daughters could write they would probably also mention the toys, the storybooks and their comfy beds. My husband was very happy with the walk-in shower. I couldn't help but be grateful for the washing machine. I would have loved to read some of the interesting books on the bookshelf but there was just not enough time. \nWe highly recommend the Ranger's Cottage and if we ever make it back to Manly will return for sure!"

The views east and west are postcard standard and the maritime traffic is so close you could almost reach out and touch it!\nFor those with a car it can be a little tricky finding a parking space,but at least its free thanks to the residents parking permit Gary provides.The real transport option is the ferries . These leave from the warf at the bottom of the building on a regular schedule .\nThe apartment itself is classic 1930's,with two good size bedrooms,a large bathroom ,kitchen , and the living room and diningroom at the end of the hall (with the best views !!).Its all been upgraded in the recent past and is very relaxed and \"homey\"...\nPerhaps the best thing I can say is that we were so comfortable there,it's going to be our regular accomodation (if its not boooked out!), whenever we are in Sydney."

Considering how close it is to the middle of town, the double\nglazing made it very peaceful, and also seemed to keep the place\ncooler on a very hot weekend. Redfern has a  really good buzz, with\nlots of cool small bars, and good restaurants in walking distance.\nSome great cafes for breakfast, although with an espresso machine in\nthe apartment it did make it easier to wake up in the morning. Redfern\nstation is a five minute walk, or a ten minute walk to Central and the\nsouthern end of the CBD. Great location and transport options\n(including the Airport Line train) for getting around.\n\nThe bed is amazing. It's firm and really comfortable - and is\nseriously the biggest bed I have seen. Its about a foot wider than a\nking and we just didn't want to get out of it! We also folded out the\nsofa bed and that is really comfy too.\n\nAll in all, this was a great stay, and we both would recommend Paul's\napartment (and Redfern in general) for locals, interstate or\ninternational guests."

Paul was very kind and went out of his way to make us feel welcome in his home, even running to the store to buy milk and make us tea on our arrival.  There was every convenience, a well-stocked kitchen, wi-fi, laundry, and the apartment was very quiet.  We would recommend Paul's place to anyone staying in Sydney, great value and a wonderful host!"

Paul was great to deal with - quick to respond to any questions and having to pick up the key from a lock-box made checking in so much easier.\nApartment was ideal with everything you needed and a great location. I tend to walk every where but on the couple of occasions I did get a train, Redfern station is less than 5 mins away and is a major hub. For a change of pace and a cheap meal also recommend taking a stroll along Redfern St and checking out Tudor Hall. Excellent chicken schnitzel and a great patio.\n\nGreat time all round - Thanks Paul."

It is surely the biggest bed in Sydney ! Thanks to the double glazing, the flat is really quite, and located in a very friendly neighbourhood.\n\nI would recommend Paul and his flat to anyone willing to spend a good time in Sydney."

The apartment is in a very handy location and was easy to get to (Paul's instructions were excellent) and having the secure parking with easy access to the apartment was fantastic, it is a very nice, clean, quiet modern space and everything you need is there, kitchen is great, not that we cooked  we were on holidays, too many restaurants so little time but it's all there if you want that including a dishwasher. The bed was awesome, very comfy!!

We love old buildings as we use to live in an historic community so his house felt very much like home.  Our favorite spot was the backyard.  You can have your coffee or tea in the morning sitting on the porch enjoying the beautiful Sydney weather.  Annandale is an adorable village of Sydney.  We recommend the Clover Cafe a block down the street.  You can also walk to the harbor at the end of Johnston St and follow it all the way to the Sydney Opera House.  It's a very long walk but a lovely one.  However,  if long walks are not your thing you can walk to Darling Harbour and catch a ferry.  Glebe is right next door w/ many cafes, restaurants and bars/pubs.  It's a very young hip community.  We would definitely stay w/ Wyatt again!  "
